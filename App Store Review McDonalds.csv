While in the parking garage I will place an order for two hot mocha McCafes for pick up on my app. I then walk to an area where I get a face mask and have my temperature taken then eneter the building.  This is around 8:00 am.  If I‚Äôm lucky someone will be behind the counter to help me.  My order is never ready and I always have to wait for my coffees to be made.  Meanwhile people are coming in behind me placing orders, getting their food and drinks and leaving.  There are also times when I walk into the restaurant and not only is no one behind the counter, no one is anywhere to be found, not even in the food prep area.  I have to call out or shout so someone will come out from a closed door to wait on me.  Then again I have to wait for my coffees to be made.  I got the McDonald's app hoping my order while placed in advance would be ready for me upon arrival.  Not once has it been.  I skip paying since the app has no problem taking my payment.  I wish your service was that efficient!  But it isn‚Äôt!  I have found my experiences dissapointing and frustrating!

1,2022-11-02 17:52:33,False,Frequent user,3,"As a busy graduate student, this app was a life saver. I could always find something quick to choose from to snack on or eat; and my points would continue to add up. However like the prior poster, I could order on this app, and sometimes no one would even know you are waiting. I live outside the city of Douglas, but I also use it in my commutes to Sierra Vista and Tucson. One particular time I ordered from my main store location ( in fact the only one) here  in Douglas and ended up waiting 30 minutes. I still had to go into the store and ask for my order, upon which they  still owe me approximately $7 - $10 worth of food. Which at time, I did not care considering, I was waiting for an order ( but their customer  service was awful)I was going to pick up, but no one acknowledged my presence though my vehicle was parked in the pick up slot, no I am sorry‚Ä¶nothing. Top it off they gave me an incomplete order. After my 30 minute wait, I could less I just wanted out of there. 

Now I have had app for sometime - a year at least and now it does not want to work. I have not changed phones - I still have my I phone 12 pro max. Now every time I want to order using this app it tells me I have to log in, though I am on the homepage. It will not even show me the menu. I register my phone again, and I get to a screen that tell me page cannot load please try again later. So this app has essentially become useless overnight. What a disappointment.",AndreaBurns3,,McDonalds
2,2021-08-11 15:33:01,False,Don‚Äôt turn your screen off,2,"I recently had to place an order three times because the app timed out when my screen went to sleep. Thankfully it only charged me once. 
I placed the initial order on our way to the restaurant. My screen turned off on the way there after placing the order. When we arrived at the restaurant there was no record of my order in the app. My debit card was recently destroyed so Apple Pay was the only option until my new card came in. So I tried to place the order at the restaurant, but the entire app had timed out meaning I had to log in again. For some reason it wouldn‚Äôt log me in. I kept getting error messages. We were in a hurry so I had to leave the restaurant. The app started working again when we got home and since my husband had promised our toddler nuggets, I went back out to get the meal (I really didn‚Äôt mind). Since I was having issues ordering at the restaurant, I placed the order at home and then drove over. Again, the order was not on record. Thankfully the entire app didn‚Äôt time out and I was able to place the order at the restaurant. Took them 25 minutes to get my food out to the car.
I doubt I will use the app again. It was such a hassle and took so much longer than the drive through or even ordering through door dash. Other stores, like chick fil a, have figured out how to let people place an order before getting to the restaurant. It doesn‚Äôt seem like it‚Äôd be a difficult thing to do.",Jennysub,,McDonalds
3,2021-04-16 17:23:43,False,Unable to Even Use the App,1,"I don‚Äôt even know what more to do about this app... I guess I just won‚Äôt ever get to use the daily deals or use a mobile order since it has NEVER worked on my phone. I have an IPhone 12 Pro that has the newest software update and have tried over and over again to delete the app and re download without any success. Even before I got the 12 Pro I had the X and for over a year now I‚Äôve always gotten a message when I tried logging in that said ‚ÄúCritical Error has Occurred, App needs to restart.‚Äù I tried logging into an existing account that I had created a few years back and got this message every single time so I tried signing up for a new account and still received this message. I contacted McDonald‚Äôs via phone and someone in their IT department said they would ‚Äúpass along the information to their developers and hopefully with the next update it would be fixed.‚Äù Today I tried to re download the app again since it‚Äôs $1 fries for mobile users and I thought just maybe today it will work for me... nope! So now when I download the app it just completely crashed and doesn‚Äôt even load. I have missed out on so many deals and feel beyond frustrated that I can‚Äôt even do a mobile order for pickup. I researched online and other people have had this same issue without getting it resolved. You would think that with McDonald‚Äôs being one of the largest corporations in the world that they would have figured out all these bugs and issues by now.

4,2021-09-28 00:13:38,False,"Terribly designed app, many stores not fully trained for the app",2,"For starters, I‚Äôm generally against fast food apps because it‚Äôs typically faster to just order it in the drive through but I thought I would give the McDonald‚Äôs app a shot since they have some pretty good deals. I just wish this app were designed a little better and the stores were a little better trained for mobile orders. One big problem I have is the unnecessary requirement to share your location. This just feels like a huge violation of privacy and for no gain. They want you to share your location and it actively uses it anytime you even open the app. I can kind of understand it so they can estimate when they need to prepare your order and I believe that is their reason, but; 1) if it already tracks your location why should you have to click in the app that you arrived at the restaurant? 2) since it is a fast food restaurant, most of the time your order should already be ready. I guess the app just guarantees it? The app actively tracks your location, and not request a location like it should if it wants that. The deals are kind of annoying because they cannot be combined and can only be used once per hour. Overall, the app just feels like a way for McDonald‚Äôs to steal your information and takes a lot of work to save $1. The app doesn‚Äôt even improve the ordering process because some stores will have problems finding your order",$aver of cash,"{'id': 25556930, 'body': 'We want to make the best Mobile App we can.

Yeah, you gain points quick and there are good deals on there, so overall I would say it‚Äôs worth having, but the glitches are too much. For starters, every single time I open my app (unless it‚Äôs multiple times in one day) it says I‚Äôve been logged out due to an error, and have to log back in again. It is just a few clicks, but it‚Äôs beyond annoying, especially when you‚Äôre trying to get food from a fast food restaurant, well, fast. Secondly, there have been countless times I‚Äôve had to completely redo an order because a promo/deal was not longer available at my location‚Ä¶even though it takes me literal minutes to order because most of my stuff is saved. If it was no longer available, why show it as an option? Finally, the stress with workers not wanting to honor deals when I don‚Äôt do mobile ordering is terrible. 90% of the time they scan a reward they say it‚Äôs not valid, just to have a manager have to come and tell them how to enter it manually because it‚Äôs an app issue not a promo issue.

6,2022-06-04 16:39:23,False,Poor connection protocol,5,"About a month ago I began experiencing problems with my McDonald‚Äôs app. I was asked by the app to connect a credit card to the account which I had already done. Every time I tried to get in I was reminded to try to connect a credit card. After many attempts attempts to correct this I finally decided I would try to connect a card. Once I did that the app has gone into a new mode where every time I open it it wants to take me through several iterations I‚Äôm trying to sign in when before I was automatically signed in once I open the app. Now it takes 4 or 5 attempts to get through the ‚Äúuse PayPal,‚Ä¶ use email‚Äù questions.

7,2021-11-19 19:57:33,True,‚ÄúUpgraded‚Äù but still far from perfect,2,"It‚Äôs mind-boggling how an app is promoted for a fast food joint but yet not have everything on the App Menu as the ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù would. I searched through the app, through the ‚Äúdeals‚Äù and it was simply not there. I go to the ‚Äúrestaurant‚Äù and it‚Äôs available as an option. The two need to be synced for optimal experience for the user. Update (1) - now when you Checkout and state you are at the location for pickup, it wouldn‚Äôt allow for me to select an option of how I want to pick up (curbside, drive-thru, etc.). Small item as such needs to be fixed.
Update (2) - now it seems the Meals are ‚Äúsynced‚Äù along with the option of how to pick up BUT one outstanding issue still remains - When the location is to make the food. It won‚Äôt allow you to do it while on route or close by. Nope. You have to select it while you are in the parking lot of the location. Why is that bad? Because when you select to pick up in store, the food is still not ready. At times, the folks on the line get their food first still. Pickup for Drive-thru‚Ä¶well you would have to wait if there is a long line (still!). ‚ÄúCurbside‚Äù - similar issue as pick-up in-store option. Food is not yet ready.

8,2021-03-07 17:53:47,False,Beware of changes,5,"The McDonald‚Äôs app has been great generally over the years. But when they change it you lose earned rewards. I‚Äôve done so many times, the worst recentlyWhen they changed from my caf√© rewards to the regular McDonald‚Äôs rewards. In the past for every five coffee drinks you bought you would get one free. I had bought coffee almost daily on my way to work and hardly ever redeemed them. At one time I had over 28 or 29 mccaf√© coffee‚Äôs to redeem. Even though the expiration date had passed one day I noticed seven or eight of them had disappeared. So I started using them. I built them up again and again and use them here and there. Maybe a month ago I had 22 Mccaf√© drinks and they change the app again to rewards instead of the caf√© drinks. I checked the app and I were seven showing four or five of which had to be redeemed within a few days or they would disappear/expire. I didn‚Äôt have time to use the mall and ended up losing four or five of those. If you figure those drinks run an average of 4 to 5 dollars each and lost a couple hundred dollars and drinks over the years. And I bought a couple hundred coffees  a year from McDonald‚Äôs.

9,2022-10-14 02:04:05,False,This app is awful,1,"I have spent the last several months trying to get this app to work. I have emailed at least six times and have only received a canned response that I may be entering my email wrong and that is why I get an error message stating that I need to enter a valid email to sign in. The automated response says to call if I continue to have trouble. I have done this. They take all my info and note the issue I am having. They say they will elevate to IT department. The only response I get is a confirmation email that they have noted my issue. This is ridiculous. If you can‚Äôt fix the issue say so. Just stop sending auto replies without helping. I can‚Äôt score points or use your app. I obviously have an account since you send me emails but I can‚Äôt sign and you never respond to me except for ads and generic auto replies when I contact customer service. Then I contact you by phone and they can‚Äôt figure out the problem and say someone will contact me. No one ever does. I have been doing this for nearly 2 years and nothing has ever been resolved. I have never been able to sign onto the app or add any points and you don‚Äôt seem to care that your customer service is inconsistent, unreliable and ineffective.

10,2018-07-02 03:21:26,False,It‚Äôs coming along,4,"Regular updates actually do make improvements to ordering (really glad to see drinks ordered by type in the latest update instead of a ten page long menu of every drink in every size), and the CS team was responsive the one time I contacted them.

The sheer scale of McDonald‚Äôs locations almost makes a single app a foolhardy idea, but this one works a lot of the time. When it does, it‚Äôs fantastic - I like being able to see what‚Äôs on a sandwich and specify no (or extra) of a topping, and the Deals are often really good. I also love being able to park in a curbside spot and wait with my radio and AC, rather than wait in the store or at the drive thru lane.

The problem is the menu in the app, which appears to cover all markets and includes items my local stores don't offer. Sometimes it stops you before you place the order, and other times the order just errors out with no explanation. So be wary of ordering any items you wouldn't see on the store's displayed menu, like Sweet Chili or Szechuan dipping sauces, or the Oreo Frappe, which is in there even though my local stores act like it doesn't exist. (And come on, just make me a Mocha Frappe and sprinkle some Oreo crumbs from the Flurry station in it.

11,2022-04-18 06:43:41,False,This App and McDonald‚Äôs is garbage,1,"So I had a lovely experience with this app yet again but this one tops it all.  I went to McDonald‚Äôs today.  I ordered through the app because of the deals the app has.  I went through the process and got to the screen where it says curbside.  I selected number 3 for the third stop.  I wait waited 20 minutes only to go through the drive through to have them tell me that there is no record of my order.  I showed the rude manager my receipt on the app on my phone and showed my bank statement of the the exact moment when I bought food through their app.  She refused to give me my order because she said if it is not in the system then it never existed.  But having for forms of prove showing that I did proved her otherwise.  She still would not give me my food.  McDonald‚Äôs I not sure how you train your managers but maybe you need to go back and teach every single one about not just customer service but general manners.  Also maybe teach them how to use the app because no one in the building of all of your excellent employees know how to use it.  Lesson that I learned today.  Your app is garbage, it glitches and when I have 2 forms of proof showing I purchased food at your establishment, please have your manager refrain from insulting my intelligence and when they are in the wrong to apologize and say they made a mistake.

12,2022-10-12 00:04:27,True,Terrible idea,1,So if I had to make a complaint it would be directed to the geniuses who invented this app. Let‚Äôs think through the purpose of an App - make your life easy to get what you want and better for the business. Correct. Well as it turns out this app does nothing for you that you can‚Äôt do at the drive through. Because when you order from the app you have to sit in line at the drive through to still order your food. This is a waste of time. It would be worth it if you ordered the food and then parked in a spot and let‚Äôs say checked in. That would be ideal. But I wasn‚Äôt able to do that. And I‚Äôm a moron. Quick update. I was messaged saying this feature is available. It is absolutely not. Maybe it‚Äôs on the app but you can‚Äôt actually do that. No matter what they say you‚Äôll be sitting in line. I deleted the app and had McDonald‚Äôs delete all my info. If I have to Sit and wait in the drive through might as well order it from there. Instead of arguing with me why don‚Äôt you have the McDonald‚Äôs location get it‚Äôs act together and allow the app to be used properly. Novel idea eh and again I‚Äôm the stupid one.  Ok so I‚Äôll concede that point. So then the app is insignificant if you can‚Äôt do curbside pick up - when the restaurant doesn‚Äôt offer that as an option. So then what is the point of the app?

13,2019-01-08 22:48:40,False,Used to be better,3,"I have had the McDonald‚Äôs app since the beginning and always been an advocate and even encouraged my friends to get it. The thing is I don‚Äôt eat anything at McDonald‚Äôs besides fries and salads items, occasionally I may get a dessert or chicken item. In the beginning I was really able to take advantage of the $1 fry deals and the $3 off $10 or $1 off $7. As of recently, about 2 months, those deals are no longer there so I really no longer have anything to gain which is quite disappointing because I do love the app and have been such a fan. I just purchased some items that would have been $4 less had I still had my regular deals. If these new changes to the app will be permanent I only wish McDonald‚Äôs would consider deals that are frequented by consumers so that they can be tailored and continue to be taken advantage of. Also consider dietary needs and restrictions I used to have 10-20 deal to select from now I have 3-7 that I know I will not use. For example, I have a free any size soft beverage deal in my app right now, I can‚Äôt drink soda so I have no use for such a coupon. I have a $1 off a quarter pounder or Big Mac, also something I can‚Äôt have so it will go to waste. Then I have 2 others for a total of 4 deals that I cannot even take advantage of.

They‚Äôve done way too much to make it all fancy, that it makes the app work so slowly, when navigating between the different functions, especially when it first starts up. Also, annoying that certain deals are scan only, mobile only, deliver only...a deal is a deal. Why should it matter if we use it on the app, at the restaurant, or delivery? And stop the restrictions on using one deal for a certain amount of time!!! If I wanna use a deal, and get back to the end of the line to use another deal, I should be able to do so like the app allowed you to do originally! The new updates have not made anything better, but instead made it more buggy. I‚Äôve never had to keep logging back into my account before, but now it seems like the app can‚Äôt remember my login, even if I had already logged in 10 minutes prior, which is very annoying when you‚Äôre already in line and waiting for the now slow app to load up and then show the deals, with people waiting behind you. There should be a face/finger ID or stay logged in option.

15,2019-08-28 17:30:22,False,No Good Deals,1,"This review is long overdue and after not being able to use the only good coupon I have got on this app in months because my McDonald‚Äôs that I always go to is no longer a ‚Äúparticipating location,‚Äù I finally feel the need to write this review. This app used to be SPECTACULAR and there were always plenty of coupons I could use daily and they were very good deals too! I was able to purchase food for myself and my family without breaking the bank too much. Then randomly one day they changed the entire app and removed all of the good coupons. Now there is one coupon daily (If I‚Äôm lucky two) and it can hardly be considered a ‚Äúdeal‚Äù as I‚Äôm saving like 30¬¢ rather than the $3-4 I used to save from a coupon. You can also get a coupon from this Plinko style game that you sometimes have to play a few times to even land something in the bag. From my experience you can play until you win however the $1 off coupon you receive after is normally never for anything I want so it‚Äôs hardly worth it. Not to mention it seems you have to use this coupon while ordering through the app and sitting in the parking lot, which is not my preferred way to eat at McDonald‚Äôs.

17,2021-01-03 17:13:28,False,10-11am is a disaster,1,"At about 10:15am I was thinking to go to McDonald's for breakfast.  There is always the question of when breakfast is no longer served - app said 11am for my McDonald's.  Great!  I have more than enough time.  So I get there at about 10:25 and try to place my order via the app.  I get an error that certain items are no longer available and those are removed.  Darn, I'll need to select something else.  I go back to the menu and it's the same menu with all the items available.  Try to order again, unavailable.  I kill the app and reopen it to try to ""refresh"" the available items.  Same menu, and trying to order many of these items still gave me the same ""unavailable"" message.  At this point I am very frustrated and go to the nearby Starbucks instead.

I assume what happened is that perhaps there is a more limited breakfast menu from 10:30-11:00 even though 1) it said breakfast until 11, and 2) the app was giving me the same full breakfast menu even at 10:35.  What's frustrating is that the app has the ability to understand the item availability since it errored during checkout, but apparently this information is not incorporated when ""building"" the menu that is shown.  So it's basically trial-and-error to find something available.

18,2018-09-28 22:23:14,False,Sometimes works,3,"Soooo...it sometimes works like it should, but it‚Äôs still buggy. And...I‚Äôve experienced that the employees at various locations aren‚Äôt well trained with mobile ordering. On more than one occasion I‚Äôve tried to pick up my order in the drive-thru, but the employee couldn‚Äôt close it out on their end. My card ends up getting charged several times, and I don‚Äôt get my food if I don‚Äôt have a way to pay for it on me. Therefore, I usually opt for curbside, which I don‚Äôt like doing either. I hate having the employees have to bring my food out to the mobile pickup if the weather is bad. Plus, if the order is wrong, then they have to go inside and come back out. 

One feature that is problematic with mobile ordering is that whatever phone you place the order from has to be the one arriving at the location because the app is tracking the phone. Almost all other mobile ordering apps don‚Äôt do that. For instance, if another family member is out and about and I‚Äôm sitting at home, I can‚Äôt order from the app and they pick it up. It tells me I‚Äôm not at the location. That‚Äôs annoying.

Lastly, the coupon deals are clunky. The coupon codes differ for each location. Therefore, you have to make sure you have the right location selected to get the correct coupon.

Good way to steal your money. Their solution is to just contact your bank and dispute it with them. They‚Äôll do the transactions and take your money, but they want no part in giving you customer service for refunds lol. Such a good joke from such a large company. I‚Äôve done the order from app and skip the line and wait at the stall for them to bring out your order. At two different McDonald‚Äôs I had the same experience. No one wants to bring out the food because they are lazy or short staffed so you wait 30 mins to an hour for your food. But your food is made, it is just sitting there getting cold. You can call the number on the sign, but sometimes they won‚Äôt answer or they will say they are short staffed because no one wants to work at McDonald‚Äôs for such low pay and they will try to get it out. 30 mins later you get your order and it is hard cold almost inedible fries, and a completely old sandwich. That‚Äôs where the non existent app support comes in. What do you do if your food is cold and inedible? You get no help on the app for a refund. They just take your money and the McDonald‚Äôs that gave you the cold inedible food will say the app is separate and they don‚Äôt deal with it.

20,2022-01-26 16:18:01,False,Good for fast food apps but a few bugs.,5,"This is clearly the best app I‚Äôve used for any fast food restaurant. It works. And I don‚Äôt mean just the app on your device, but the back office operations that are required to fulfill your order.  
The worst bug I experience is after one picks up their food. A day or two may go by, and then when I open to use the app again it hasn‚Äôt cleared out my past fulfilled order, and it automatically reloads the past order into the cart.  Then I have to go manually delete every item that I ordered before, so I can make a new order. Not a giant problem, more like just annoying. 
Not a formal bug, but a design error IMO, As I wish they made it easier to add condiments to an order. I think it should be the last thing selected before a person confirms their order. It‚Äôs easy to forget to add the condiments, then when I pick up my food I ask the personnel on duty for it, and although I get it, I can tell it‚Äôs a tiny annoyance for them - a break in their flow.  
Regardless, I‚Äôm impressed and happy with it. The formalized ‚Äúmenu hacks‚Äù feature to be released soon sounds awesome.",ToRoom101,,McDonalds

I tried a different location, the first time the manager told me I had failed to pay for my order so I needed to drive back around to the first window and pay. There is NO OPTION but to make payment in app. The third time, not quite as bad, I had to drive up to the window and tell them my order so they could find it. Third time? I was told repeatedly they didn‚Äôt have any mobile orders, I had to go inside to straighten it out. Understand, THERE IS NO WAY TO CHECK IN UNTIL YOU ARE AT THE STORE. It uses GPS to track your location and it won‚Äôt check you in until you are almost in the parking lot. I know, I‚Äôve tried. You literally cannot order from the wrong location, so THEY HAVE TO HAVE YOUR ORDER IF YOU CHECK IN. Even now as I type this, they don‚Äôt show my order as complete.

22,2019-09-07 17:05:13,False,Worst app ever,1,Over engineered and poorly executed.  Downloaded the app and placed my first order.  We were good up to this point.  After placing the order and paying with Apple Pay the app went to a page that told me I had to  tell the app when I was close so that the order would be prepared.  No option to simply say be ready in 30 minutes.  My plan was to place the order and have someone else pick it up.  Not happening if I have to tell it I am close using my phone.  Drive to McDonald‚Äôs where the app tracked my location.  It did not automatically submit the order for preparation when I was near so I am not sure why they needed to track my location.  When I arrived I pressed the I am already here link in the app.  It then popped over to a screen telling me I had to select my pickup option.  Unfortunately the screen which I assume was supposed to have options was blank.  The  employees at McDonald‚Äôs had no idea what to do and didn‚Äôt really care either way.  Restarted the app several time but always ended up on the same blank pickup options screen.  I was able to cancel the order and reorder from the kiosk inside the store until that failed when I tried to pay at the kiosk.  Took me twice as long to get lunch as it would have to just walk in and place my order at the counter.  The reason I rated this app so poorly is not only that it failed to perform but that McDonald‚Äôs is capable of so much better than this.,Ntfreak,,McDonalds

He has like this shocked little on his face and another lady comes to the window and says can u get in the drive thru line (which by the way has at least 12 card in it). I said do you know how long that line is and I‚Äôve already been waiting almost 20 mins then she said ok as soon as this car finishes I will bring you your food. So I wait and wait and wait. After the 6th car passes no one comes to the window or anything. I was so mad I drove around and got in the drive thru line which is wrapped around the building now. This is the worst customer service ever. You guys should be ashamed of yourself. If I could have gotten my money back from the app I would have left and went somewhere else. No one even apologized they just acted like nothing was wrong. It‚Äôs called fast food for a reason. I can‚Äôt believe I placed an order at 915 and still haven‚Äôt gotten my order as of 956.

Twice at the Thousand Oaks branch where my order never arrived even though I had a confirmation and showed it to the attendant.  Her manager couldn‚Äôt figure it out.  He just said that they have nothing to do with the app.  Two different departments.  I had to call my credit card and get a refund on one and the other time my credit card company said it did not come through.  But what a hassle.  

The other two times were at the Ventura branch on Telegraph Rd.  There were items missing.  The first time they saw the glitch and apologized that I had to return and compensated me with coupons.  The second time I caught it on the confirmation that fries were missing so I had to go inside and wait in a line for a lengthy time.  It was chaos behind the counter, kitchen and customers.  

On my last visit I placed a special deal order. Everything was fine until we got to the checkout. By the time I looked up my credit card information and went back to inputted the check out said my deal was no longer available. I had to delete it and start over again.  So I did.

25,2018-10-29 23:48:16,False,Do not use this app!,1,"The reason I liked this app was the convenience of ordering food for my kids if they‚Äôre hungry and I‚Äôm at work. They can walk over and pick up their food, and I pay right from my phone. Convenient right? Nope! I ordered from work one day, it was a little confusing and I had to hit back a few times to get the location right, or so I thought... well my daughter walked over, I screenshot and sent her the order confirmation. She‚Äôs waiting and they say no order. So I check the order again and it said it was ordered at another McDonalds down the road and I KNOW I clicked the right McDonalds when I placed my order. Anyways I called both McDonalds to see if they can transfer the order and they were NO HELP! Told me I needed to call the contact number on the app, well I did and was told that the charges are pending but it won‚Äôt clear since I never picked up my order. Today I look and see the charges cleared for $20 worth of food that I never got and McDonalds knows it was never picked up and that I was totally scammed! I call again and I am told I need to dispute the charges with my bank. Are you kidding me? This app is a joke and so is McDonalds. Deleting and never using again! I‚Äôve been using the Starbucks app for years and never had problems like this. McDonald‚Äôs ripped me off of $20!

26,2020-05-20 16:16:36,False,Nice exclusive deals but Payment Failures kill it,1,"Overall I enjoyed the app where I could customized my order specifically how I wanted it and could clearly see the price increase for each option - who wouldn‚Äôt more pickles for free or a extra slice of cheese for 30 cents.  Also there are daily app exclusive deals and coupons like buy one get one that are great and makes ordering tempting.  However; the issue and an app killer for me is the payment system.   Last 3 trips I ordered and set up for curbside delivery.  A few minutes latter the app shows there‚Äôs been an error and I need to ‚Äúgo inside to see the cashier‚Äù, so in these social distancing days that means going through the drive through.  When you pull up they can see your order but they say the Payment is still pending.  Each time I check the app and it gives me no option to retry payment or other options.  So i tell them at the window to cancel the order and end up leaving with no food.   I have now discovered that the charge later went through and still showed up on my credit card statement.  So now I have wasted time on trips to the restaurant, no food, and yet still get charged.  Now I have to spend more time on phone with credit card disputing the charges.

27,2018-10-17 02:33:52,False,Last thing you want,1,Me writing a review of this app would be almost as bad as you asking me to review the quality of service at your store in Moorestown NJ. Both are equally as bad. I've found countless stores that get everything right all the time but never one like mine. How is it possible to screw up one customers order ten times in a row? Statistically with all the other customers it is impossible. Just like it should be impossible for the app to fail loading every time I try to use the deals section at prime hours but it does. And only then. Works just fine at two in the morning or ten at night. Go figure. But like I said you don't really want to hear all that from me. You need to wipe that location off the map and start with a new store.  Building and all cause it must be cursed. And I've written to HQ and to the actually owner plus the manager for luck. Never heard back which really disappointed me. So now instead of going there several times a week I go to Wendy's or Burger King. And on special occasions I will go to McDonald's but after the attitude the woman gave me at Moorestown I'll probably stop doing that. I broke a cardinal rule. I asked for tenders after nine at night. I once asked at eleven and thought the guy was going to hit me. You'd think if something is that popular you'd order enough to cover the entire day. I guess McDonald's isn't smart enough. Cause that isn't a Moorestown issue. That happens at all of them.,scottbender83,,McDonalds

My one-star off may be more of a problem with implementation on the restaurant level. The app doesn‚Äôt save a whole lot of time because you have to be next to the restaurant to check in anyway. I understand something could come up and prevent you from arriving to receive your order... but with the Starbucks App your order gets started right away (now that app has its own problems, half the time it can‚Äôt find the store I‚Äôm 2 blocks away from, but that‚Äôs another review). Because of this I find myself getting breakfast sandwiches at Starbucks more often even though I would prefer the fresh cracked eggs at McDonald‚Äôs. Maybe put a disclaimer box that people can confirm/check when they order that stipulates that if they are unable to pick up their order within 20 min it will be discarded with no refund offered.  If you enter a busy McDonald‚Äôs nowadays it takes a whiiiile to get your food. Usually I‚Äôll confirm that I‚Äôm at the restaurant on my app but then sit in my car for 10 min before going in -and sometimes end up waiting another 10 min anyway! Just can‚Äôt win.

It‚Äôs a horrible experience that simply discourages me from going to McDonald‚Äôs.

So I thought ordering through this new app would solve that whole debacle and make for a faster, more pleasant experience. Unfortunately, I have yet to be able to successfully order anything. I added one of the daily deals and then tried to order an additional burger along with it, but could only select from breakfast items (it was definitely past breakfast time), so I gave up for that day. A few days later, I tried ordering again, but when I tried to add a new deal, the app says I can only add one deal per order. Sure enough, the deal I had added before is still in my bag, but expired and I couldn‚Äôt for the life of me figure out how to delete it (I‚Äôve since figured it out, but well after the fact).

I got so frustrated that I stopped using the McDonalds app and started using the apps from Wendy‚Äôs and Jack-in-the-Box. Sometimes, the Wendy's app doesn‚Äôt work. So, I just go into Wendy‚Äôs and ask if I can still make use of the offer in the app even if it wasn‚Äôt working. To my surprise, they manually process it for me. Just want to mention that Wendy‚Äôs and Jack in the box have really good deals in their apps. Today, I thought that I‚Äôd try to give the McDonald‚Äôs app another chance. But guess what!

Submitted my order, opened the app and indicated that I was at the restaurant and waited for my order. After some time I checked with staff and they didn‚Äôt receive the order. They were great and rushed to make my order for me, but the technology was an issue. I complained to McD just so they would know they had something to fix, and they acknowledged the problem and sent me free coupons.
So I decided to try again, it‚Äôs gotta work great by now (Sep). Well, I was at a different location then my local one so I tried to set it to the restaurant I was at. It didn‚Äôt seem to want to, but eventually did. I placed the order and it charged my card, but said my order was being sent to the wrong restaurant. There was no way to cancel the order that I could find. I thought i could just order again but at this point it wouldn‚Äôt let me pick the restaurant and indicated the restaurant was not open even though I was standing in it :/ Well, there is a charge for the order, but if I go to my history of orders there is only the one from May and actually shows my items in the shopping cart!

I am a very busy person, and using the app doesn‚Äôt save me time, and often times it can be pretty inconvenient to use.

They were actually doing to go orders in the store. I would have rather done that, however, there was no option for to go orders on the app. Only curbside or drive thru were offered.

***In response to the developer‚Äôs response to my grievances with this app, I‚Äôd say that I still stand firm that the app needs work. It‚Äôs literally the slowest way to order at McDonald‚Äôs.

However, there are a couple of refinements that'll bring this up to 5 stars:

1: If I star a location, please use that as a default; the location chooser should have it as a drop-down menu of nearest store, starred store, and perhaps a ""other"" option at the bottom instead of showing the closest location and bringing up the map when you click on it... I get that you choose the geographically closer store, but it's out of my way, but I want the store that is 0.1 miles further but en route of my commute. In its current state, it's actually more tedious to select your starred restaurant.

2. I've emailed about it before; if I've gone through the hassle of mobile order, one perk should be that the food is ready by the time I walk in, especially if my end goal is to not have to wait. However, if I have to order ahead, then check in and wait (I can't check in from home a mile down the street), there is no incentive for me to actually order with the app since it's actually faster to place the order with the cashier.",EdWaRdW818,"{'id': 6909231, 'body': ""Hello, Edward!

Despite that I‚Äôve managed to make regular orders without a hitch. One major aspect I find lacking both in the kiosk order and the mobile app is the fact I can‚Äôt do simple customizations like substitute sauces. I for one am not a major fan of ketchup on my burger. Besides mayonnaise I typically have no other options. Whenever I buy a McDouble at the store I always add Mac sauce instead of ketchup and I‚Äôm willing to pay the extra fee if the need arises. But despite doing exactly what it‚Äôs advertised, I feel it fails in something that may not be common sense but is definitely important.

The app itself is fine and easy to use. Unfortunately the employees seem to not know how it works.

Getting to the food window, they didn‚Äôt have my order nor did they seem to know anything about it. After waiting at the ‚Äúwe screwed up your order‚Äù window (I‚Äôve been there many times) for several minutes they bring me a sack. They also completely forgot my drink and skimped on the fries for good measure. And when I arrived home I discovered that they had messed up the order as well. 
So despite me entering it for them, handling the payment, and repeating the whole thing at the window‚Äîthey still managed to screw it up. 
So I do not recommend using the app. It does not help at all and just creates more confusion.

Buying five earns the guest a free McCafe beverage! Lovi‚Äôin that! However, if I choose to take advantage of any other deal during that transaction, my McCafe credit is canceled out in Lieu of the new deal selected. My dilemma is do I choose the McCafe credit or an optional deal??? Or make the single transaction a multiple transaction experience; taking advantage of other options in the lineup. How stressful and time consuming!! Can I suggest deals that require multiple purchases in order to be rewarded with a future treat be a totally separate rewards program.

But, sure enough, every time I open the app up, my previous order is still there in the cart. Weird. ‚Ä¢ When I first started using the app, it absolutely would not let me use my personal email address. So I used my work email address. Recently, I was logged out of the app and I needed access to my email to log back in. Problem is: new job. So I tried again to sign up with my personal email address and I still couldn‚Äôt, soooooo‚Ä¶ new work email address. Lord. The (biggest) problem? Last I checked, I had like 57,000 points saved up.

The issue is that when I get close to the McD location, i complete the transaction on my app and pay for my order. When I get to pick up my order, the staff tells me my order did not go through and I need to process payment again. Some times, that means redoing Apple Pay on my phone, and other times, it means paying cash/ credit at the register. Each time, when I check my credit card statement, I see the original transaction processed. I‚Äôve had to dispute the charge through my credit card company. This is a big problem, esp because you are forcing customers to use mobile pay to have access to coupons. If the payment issues with mobile ordering did not exist, I would be more interested and likely to visit McD. However, with these issues, it will be once in a while and definitely not with using mobile ordering until this gets fixed.

Though, I don‚Äôt wanna complain because the free drink or $1 any coffee, and the McCafe rewards are great! And lastly, I‚Äôm not sure why they stopped it (probably because the majority kept voting the same deal every day) but for about a month they had a voting poll where you could vote on what deal you‚Äôd like to use the next day which was great!

Fine, he went through the drive-thru to place our order.

Yesterday I receive an email thanking me for picking my order from a McDonalds in West Los Angeles CA.  It was not me.  Someone was able to pick up my mobile order (without my phone being present) and charged it my to American Express charge card for this order.

I called the manager at the West Los Angeles CA location who said she could not help me, even though someone there (without my phone) had picked up the order there posing as me.

I was told my McDonalds customer service that I could not change my password in the mobile app because it doesn‚Äôt require a password (account is tied to your mobile phone only).  How this fraudulent act occurred is beyond me.

I had to dispute the charge with American Express and request a new card number (which is a major hassle since I have regular payments tied to it).  

today, McDonalds customer service said they are going to contact the West Los Angeles CA McDonald‚Äôs to refund me.  I will believe that when (and if) I see it.

1. Default to ordering to my favorite store rather than the closest one.  The store closest to me gets everything wrong in every way possible and I am happy to drive the extra 2 miles to my favorite where the food is fresher and the service is better.

2. Please add a way to order tap water.  Even if it is a small water is free and a larger cup is an up charge, I would be happy.  Now I have to go in with 2 orders just so I can get water.

It is literally a waste of time to order ahead! I tried it a few times, at several locations. Ordered ahead thinking my food would be ready when I got there. Not the case one single time. One store had to give me credit, because they were out of an item. The first person I asked for the credit said they couldn‚Äôt do it. Had to get a manager, and still had to wait 10 minutes for my order. 
The next store took me 15 minutes after I arrived to receive my order. It seemed as if they hadn‚Äôt even noticed there was an order through the app. 
This last one is what decided it for me. I chose the ‚Äúdrive through‚Äù option to pick up my order. Window one told me I had to park to the side and they‚Äôll bring it out. She acted as if waiting at the window wasn‚Äôt an option. Well, being hard headed I insisted on going to window two. Got told again to pull to a pick up spot and they‚Äôll bring it out.

140,2020-07-04 13:16:16,False,"Decent App, Might Need In-Store Training",5,"With the recent Covid situation, I‚Äôve found myself to be using restaurant apps more frequently to order and pay remotely so as to reduce person-to-person contact.

So I‚Äôve been using several apps, and McDonald‚Äôs app usually runs pretty well. I have run into a couple of situations that the restaurant was not able to help me with.

First instance was when the restaurant was out of Coke. They asked if they could give me something else to drink, however there‚Äôs not really anything else I wanted so I requested if they could remove it from my bill. They were unable to do so so they gave me my food and I figured I would just have to pay for a Coke I didn‚Äôt get.

Second instance I believe is related to the first one. I ordered through the app and it showed I paid, however it did not show as paid in the system at the restaurant. So I gave them my card and paid in person. At that point I had not received an email receipt for the first instance, so I wonder if because that first hadn‚Äôt cleared the second wouldn‚Äôt.

Those normally wouldn‚Äôt be a problem, however around a month after those occurred, I got email receipts for both, the first having the Coke I didn‚Äôt get and the second being a double charge for what I paid for in person.

So as the title says, this is a good app, however it might require some in store training (which I understand McDonald‚Äôs employs a lot of people so that may not be realistic).",Talon Darkfire,"{'id': 16440788, 'body': 'Hi there!

Usually an okay app. However, you may want to fix the recent bug that has prevented ordering through the app. The cart doesnt allow resetting the cart. So all you can do is remove individual items. However recently it has locked expired coupons. So I‚Äôm unable to order anything because a coupon from several weeks ago is locked in my cart. I‚Äôve tried logging out and reinstalling the app, but neither does anything. I‚Äôm not sure why a store with a location- and time-specific menu would make it so difficult to clear the cart - but you may want to fix this.  And, it would make more sense if the cart also cleared after an order was completed. For some reason all of the items just stay in the cart, as if someone wants to keep reordering the same items by default.

As for improvements, there needs to be a way to add notes for the staff- like asking them to make sure they bring you ketchup, or napkins, which they sadly don‚Äôt always do without being asked.

I did so due to convenience and my perceived safety with drive through only during the COVID pandemic. I just placed an order on the app with my total $5.90 w/tax.  Immediately afterward, I happened to pop on to my Discover account to check on to my next payment due date.

Issues
1-Location step almost ignored... It‚Äôs a fundemantal step... Allows you to accidentally order at the last store four stores away
2-Pickup options like store location non issue until to late... You can walk a mile to the restaurant, hit here, then learn store closed drive-thru only
3-If you order a hot fudge sundae you shouldn‚Äôt be handed a sundae without hot fudge, ice cream or nuts after arriving... McDonald‚Äôs world best fries were ruined without the Talo, the only reason I stopped for years... The huge sodas are gone... K, health police might be right... But no nuts on a sundae ridiculous, if Mom‚Äôs gave their kids nuts earlier we would have our kids lives re-ordered for the tiny few
4-It‚Äôs false advertising to have a tripleCHEESEburger with two slices of cheese... That‚Äôs why there is a McDouble and a Double Cheeseburger
5-A CHEESEburger should be made with cheese not cheese food or cheese product... Why the food Nazis permit false fraudulent non cheese amazes
6-SIMPLIFY the menu... The made to order 1/4 pounder is the bomb... Gooey cheese, liquid juices instead of stale pre-cooked like warm
7-McDs coffee was always fresh... It always had the correct amount of sugar and cream... Now it‚Äôs either stale, short sugar or short cream 50% of orders

I‚Äôve had orders where I use my points and when I go to the restaurant, I get charged the full amount and my points are gone. I‚Äôve had to close the app after placing my order only to find out that the order is stuck in limbo (while I‚Äôm in the drivethru) and I have to completely delete my order and redo it. 

Sometimes the app glitches out during checkout and you have to delete the app completely and reinstall it to get it to come back. Sometimes you‚Äôll place an order and the next time you open the app, those same items will be in your cart from the last order so you have to manually clear the cart before placing a new order. 

Also, the switch between breakfast and lunch is just one big glitch. When you open the app during breakfast time it shows your breakfast items. Then if you open it again for lunch, the breakfast items are still displayed with notices that they are not available at all during lunch time. Even if you close the app and reopen it, it‚Äôll still show breakfast items. You have to tap around the menu to get the app to realize that it should just display lunch items instead.

-When you next use the app, even if weeks later, it retains your last order as if it was never completed.

-The app doesn‚Äôt always register when you‚Äôre at the location, even after clicking that you‚Äôre there. This may partially be due to employee training, but after years you‚Äôd really think that this was something that McDonald‚Äôs could get down
-It always assumes you want the closest McDonald‚Äôs, which may work the majority of the time... but if you‚Äôre traveling in a different direction (e.g., to work in the morning on the same route you take everyday) you have to manually change location every single time.

1. In the promotions tab on the ordering menu, make it more clear what the promotions are. Like right now there are breakfast sandwiches on 2/$4, but when you go into the promotion tab, it just shows the sandwiches. Nothing about needing to buy 2 or anything. 
2. This is totally just a personal thing for me but would allow me to use the app to order more often..... in the sodas you have ice or no ice as options. I usually order light ice. I know it seems kinda silly, but it‚Äôd be nice if I could get my stuff the way I want it without having to bother the staff to change the order when I arrive.

So so frustrating. My reasoning for ordering ahead is for the convenience of walking in, grabbing my food and walking out fast(since I‚Äôm often alone with my kids). This app needs a better tracking system. Order number should stay on screen until order is picked up. Or an email should be sent to confirm that order went through.

Next, the people at the store can‚Äôt refund tour money if there‚Äôs a problem with the app order.

Also, they ask you to check-in by putting the parking space number for mobile order pick up, nothing is always available because other customers are using the space for regular parking, so you end parking somewhere else, going in to the store to check in, instead of just waiting in your car to pick up your order.

I went to the store and the store was open. I wanted to order some nugget meals but they said they only had the items available on mobile offers. I explained that the mobile app was not actually working and showed it to the cashier who looked at me like I was crazy before. They said they could not ring up anything larger than 10 nuggets and I wanted to order the 40 nuggets and was gonna cost me about 4x the cost of the mobile order.

It was totally annoying to only be able to order once I was in the parking lot. Why even use the app when I could‚Äôve ordered AND received my food at the drive thru or in the store?! Like why not allow for mobile order from up to 2 miles away? That equates to maybe a three to five minute drive maybe? Also, there‚Äôs not status update for you to know if the food is being prepared or when it‚Äôs ready. I‚Äôm in no way using the mobile app to order until this is changed. The best mobile app experience for ordering food so far is Papa Murphy‚Äôs and Jack-in-the-box.

One other thing, there are only 3 options for customizing your order. None, Regular, & Extra. My kids like sauce but the regular is too much so it would be great for a ‚ÄúLight‚Äù option. You can do that in the store and drive thru so why not be able to do that on the app?",H5N.PNW,,McDonalds

Chick-Fil-A; Whataburger; Starbucks all offer options to pay and prepare whether at the location or not so, it‚Äôs simple to order and send another family member to pick up for me. Not McDonald‚Äôs. This app has to see that you‚Äôre at location before putting the order in.

In the beginning stages of the app payment was very simple but now the only payment form I can get to work is Apple Pay.

I was hoping that if I gave plenty of lead time my coffee would be ready for me when I arrive which should make things easier on the staff of the restaurant as well as myself.

When you place an order in this app they will not start it until you arrive at the restaurant and check in. What is the purpose of pre-ordering if not to have the food ready when you arrive? I use the Starbucks app almost every day, my coffee is always ready when I arrive at Starbucks, but given the storm I figured I‚Äôd go to the McDonald‚Äôs because it was closer. I will say the coffee is great, and a great value at $1, but it was not worth the hassle this morning having to wait for it when I pre-ordered.

After about 30 minutes I received my food. I asked the employee why it took so long to get my food when ordering through the app. It was explained to me that the App orders do not get first priority. The drive thru gets 1st priority, then the walk-in traffic, then comes the orders from the App. Once I arrived and checked in to have my food made I watched 20-25 other customers, who arrived after me, receive their food before me. McDonalds advertises for people to use the App, but then punished those who do. The App defeats the purpose of fast food.

So place the order at 10:09. As I get there, 10:35AM, it says they are getting my order ready. Ok. So I head through the drive thru and when I pull up they tell me they are no longer serving breakfast. Great

So you can‚Äôt place your order ahead of time, you have to be in the McDonald‚Äôs parking lot for your order to go through. they don‚Äôt warn you that if you arrive later than breakfast you can‚Äôt get your order, and they don‚Äôt cancel the order or notify you if you miss that window.

The app does a great job at what it‚Äôs designed to do. It‚Äôs just a flawed concept. 

Failure no.1 When you order food, the order doesn‚Äôt actually get placed until you arrive at the McDonalds. So, it‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre skipping the line. You‚Äôre just skipping speaking your order out loud to the person at the register. 

Failure no. 2 there will be some times when the restaurant doesn‚Äôt have what you ordered. Part of one of my orders was a latte. When I arrived, I was told the latte machine was down and so I was told I could choose another drink instead. The problem is the the price difference. Lattes are the most expensive drinks they sell. So, my total price should have been adjusted down. I contacted the app customer service and they suggested submitting a bank dispute. And really, that‚Äôs just a waste of everyone‚Äôs time for a difference of a couple bucks. My time, McDonald‚Äôs response to the bank, and my bank‚Äôs time. 

Failure no. 3. Glitches. I submitted an order on a different occasion and after the finish and pay screen I was saw a screen that said ‚Äúsomething went wrong on our it end.‚Äù It gave me an order number and said I should go to the counter for help. The people at the restaurant had no idea what to do, and I had to submit a whole new order.

So, overall, the app is good in theory. It just doesn‚Äôt work well in practice.

The other issue is that it‚Äôs not started until you arrive. There should be a way to either specify an arrival time to have the ability to start the order a few minutes before you arrive. This would be especially helpful when ordering breakfast at night, which take 3-4 minutes to make. You end up just waiting in a parking spot instead of in line, so it‚Äôs a little better than drive thru, but just marginally.

One other feature that would be nice is allowing you to rate your service each time.

Yay! They added an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm already here‚Äù button! Makes it much faster when your GPS is being slow, and allows you to let someone else pick up the food if needed!
Because of that, I‚Äôve upped my rating to five stars.
[end update]

Ordering through this app is pretty nice!
There‚Äôs always a coupon you can use, and it saves you time when ordering.
The only problem I really have is that the UI is a bit confusing when you want to add more to your order.

One thing I‚Äôd like added would be the option to have someone pick up your order. For example, my family was coming back from a trip to my cousin‚Äôs house. They asked if I wanted anything, so I ordered though the app. But they couldn‚Äôt pick it up because the app knew I wasn‚Äôt there.

Because of this, to save gas, they are going to order the food from scratch, and till the next time I go to McDonald‚Äôs, my phone‚Äôs GPS will be running. I could also just go to McDonald‚Äôs when they arrive, but then I‚Äôd have two orders worth of food.

Another thing they could add is to have the option to cancel an order. That way if something like this were to happen, someone else won‚Äôt be out some money till they can visit the restaurant again.",RooKata,,McDonalds

UPDATE: the app developer has requested feedback using that link. That was actually the first thing I did. No response. 

In fact this is part of the problem. There is no way recourse to a bad order. You can‚Äôt get a refund from the app developer. Unless you complain in person (remember dining rooms are closed so you can only speak to someone on the drive thru) you are unlikely to get a refund from the franchise/restaurant. 

I called the app help line once. The service rep agreed it was a bad situation and approved a refund. But she couldn‚Äôt do it there. She said someone would be in contact in a couple days. If you miss that call or don‚Äôt answer strange numbers you‚Äôve lost your chance at a refund.

The app told me that my card would not be charged until I reached the restaurant in case I had coupons or offers which was not the case and my card was charged immediately as soon as the order was submitted. I rejected our $19 order and sent the food back since they were not willing to accept the digital coupon for a BOGO Happy Meal or offer any resolution or compromise.

The deleted orders are mildly annoying, but something that I can deal with just fine, since it only takes a few moments to recreate the order. 
The changed orders placed in another state halfway across the country, however, are concerning since there is no way to cancel those orders AND since the charge is showing as pending on my bank account. I‚Äôm thinking that since I was a) never able to show up to that location and ‚Äúcheck in‚Äù to pick up that order, and b) since one of the menu items is marked as ‚Äúcurrently unavailable,‚Äù I‚Äôm thinking the charge will go away in a few days.

463,2021-02-24 01:16:46,True,A couple drawbacks,2,"biggest issue is that, though you can prepare your order from home or wherever you happen to be, it won‚Äôt be sent to the kitchen until you arrive on site and connect to the macdonalds wifi. But the time you add up selected everything, adding payment choice, and sending it in... you‚Äôd have already had your food at drive through.

Not just that, but the app does not reflect in store availability or consider the cleaning of machines ect. So all the work to make the order you had to wait to give to them when you got there (instead of just SAYING it to the speaker) often times is for nothing because they don‚Äôt have it or a dozen other reasons.

And here‚Äôs the kicker... they can either cancel the whole order, or you end up paying for whatever they don‚Äôt have, or cant give to you. There is NO REFUND option, whatsoever. 

o my good side is that there are deals if the day that are pretty good, and it keeps track of how many Mocha Frappes you‚Äôve purchased. Every 5th is free. They better be, though, since you end up not getting half of them cuz they‚Äôre ‚Äúcleaning the machine‚Äù at any hour they don‚Äôt feel like doing it.

It requires you to pick a meal time which defaults to one that may be before or after the logical one. An order isn‚Äôt placed until you check in at the location which varies whether you are eating in, picking up or waiting at curbside.

It fails on the second main reason to use the app, which is offers. The offers are almost universally terrible. $1 off hot cakes.

So the above response to my last review is incorrect.

I was so embarrassed that I just bought something else, even though it wasn't what I actually wanted (and there wasn't a coupon for it). 

If something isn't available when I place my order, the app should tell me that up front. I shouldn't have to drive to the store just to find out that I can't have what I ordered.

Customizing orders, saving orders, locating nearby restaurants. There are times when I can crank out a McDonald‚Äôs order through this app so quickly and painlessly.

However, there are bugs and glitches that significantly reduce it‚Äôs usability, for instance:

- I got to a nearby McDonald‚Äôs at 11:05. The app insisted, however, that breakfast was still being served. I could not order lunch items, nor use any coupons for lunch food, because the app insisted it was the wrong time of day. No amounts of restarting the app seemed to help it recognize that the menu had changed.

- I constantly find my account logged out, thus forcing me to sign in a lot.

- my order was wrong recently. I tried to contact McDonald‚Äôs via the app, but it wouldn‚Äôt work. I could not use the map integration to find ANY McDonald‚Äôs locations, let alone my local one. Without that information, I could not continue with my feedback.

-  recent orders do not refresh/update quickly.

However, I can‚Äôt full confirm if this is the root cause.

Then to add insults to injury the location I was at was just as confused as me then they wouldn‚Äôt allow me to move forward with the order they all ready told me I could. They also said if I use a different card or cash it would go through on a 2nd order; which it didn‚Äôt! And why should I have to use 2 different cards to pay for my order.

The coupons and offers used to be somewhat decent and switched up often, but they‚Äôve really gone downhill and become repetitious. My biggest gripe, though, is that you have to take your phone with you to utilize the mobile ordering so they can ‚Äútrack‚Äù when you‚Äôre at the restaurant. I much prefer apps like Dunkin‚Äô and several others where I can place my order and my husband can pick it up for me by using just my name, especially as a mom with a newborn who prefers to stay home WITH my phone. Not to mention that half the time we‚Äôve used the mobile ordering it has crashed or ended up with us going into the restaurant, defeating the purpose of mobile ordering in the first place.

Now I wouldn‚Äôt expect the Big Mac deal with a window poster 2 breakfast sandwiches for 4 bucks but I do expect a permanent menu item to not mix my deal. 

So what I did was cancel everything but the Big Macs to get the deal and on the way home stopped at Burger King for the other 4/5ths of the purchase. I saw that Burger King has an app and told them how McDonalds app works, they said theirs worked like I expected, get the deal plus anything else.

I had to cancel my order and drive another 20 minutes home still with no food. The app‚Äôs interface is also horrible to use and bugs out at times making it necessary to restart the app. The points system is a joke as the deals they offer only knock off a dollar or two off the order at best and you can only use one deal per order (or every 15 minutes) so you can‚Äôt rack up points and get an entire order for free or at a discounted price.

633,2021-05-27 21:58:53,False,No responsibility,1,"The App makes it clear in its terms and conditions that refunds and modifications are the responsibility of the stores.

Since I had checked in, I had been charged for the order. I called the store, and they told me to come through the drive through-another 45 minute wait, because they had nobody to bring out my order. The store agreed to refund my money but never did. The next day, they told me that all refunds must go through the app.

In one case we had ordered two cafe drinks (really the bulk of our order) and when they brought the other drink out informed us that their cafe machine was broken and they had no way to reverse the charges on our order.  Both times I had to follow-up with the manager after the fact and wait for re-imbursment.   Both times required repeated calls to the store because they don‚Äôt often answer their phone (perhaps a commentary on the actual store).

2. I use the sam MCDS every day. The one closest to my work. However, when i leave the house its not the closest one to my house and every morning I have to go in and change my Mcds location. Its 2020. Is there a reason theres no way to set a default location? Also changing locations should be quick. Not a four step process. 

3. The ap set up is not user-friendly. If youre not used to where everything is it can be frustrating. Ive been using this app for over a year now and it still frustrates me. Whats with all the small blue words to click on and the horrible menu setup. Just use buttons. Easy buttons. 

4. All the menu choices at the store are not on the menu choices on the app. Why cant i buy just a mcmuffin if i wanted? I can buy just a biscuit. Why isnt a bacon egg and cheese mcmuffin on the menu? Theres a lot of things that you have to request when you get to the window.

My biggest annoyance is that although I have a valid card saved to pay from, they always need to run my card when I get there. Last time I went, I was double charged two different amounts, clearly this is part of the app malfunctioning. I‚Äôm still waiting to hear back from the store for a refund.

Given that a particular offer has always been for one use only, there was never an issue of using one offer repeatedly. No, what I did was usually the following: get large fries for $1, complete that purchase, then get an offer for BOGO on a burger or sandwich, or for a free drink with purchase of a burger.

Now, I am effectively forced to choose which *one* offer I wish to use that day (since my visits don‚Äôt last a whole hour, and I don‚Äôt visit more than once per day.

The only offer that makes sense for me now is the punchcard for the McCafe.

Perhaps McDonalds figured out that they were losing money...but I doubt it. Given the cost, it‚Äôs more likely that they weren‚Äôt making *additional* money. 

I‚Äôm sure that those people that have enough money won‚Äôt mind not being restricted to one coupon per ‚Äúvisit‚Äù. But for those like myself without a lot of money, it means we won‚Äôt be purchasing as much per visit, or we won‚Äôt be visiting as much, if at all.

Restaurants vary widely timely completing the order. I‚Äôve had to wait way too long to receive my order inside, curbside and having to pull over in the drive through.

Where this falls down, is there‚Äôs no way to contact the restaurant when the wrong food gets brought out curbside. If an item is missing, or they bring the wrong drink, there‚Äôs no way to fix it without going inside and standing in line (which defeats the convenience of curbside). 

I realize checking the order before the employee walks away would be an ideal way to handle this. However, frequently they handoff the food and run or don‚Äôt speak the same language as I do. I‚Äôve taken to making them wait by the car until I unwrapped and check the toppings on every sandwich, but that slows down everybody.",ElisabethQ,,McDonalds

I actually need to WAIT just like others. I purposely place the order at the time I know when it should be ready, so I don‚Äôt have to wait at the restaurant. 

This means it also does not let someone else pick up the order for you. The store would never receive the order unless ‚ÄúI‚Äù(my phone) show(s) up. 

All the other mobile orders from brands such as starbucks, chipotle, dunkin donuts etc. they make the order when it‚Äôs placed, not when you‚Äôre at the restaurant.

2.

Either better training needs to be implemented, or this feature needs removed.

3. Add the option to check in when not in proximity anyways, why don't ya? #2 became an issue because i sent someone else to pick up the order. But calling in to verify they couldn't get it to work (""recalling"" the order number didn't work, and the staff member familiar with the mobile order system on site at the time said that there is no way to pull up an order if the app won't let you check in or says you're not present).

This means that you cannot use a password generator like 1Password to generate and store a good strong password and paste it. If you want to use a good strong password, you are going to have to end up typing it yourself tediously on the tiny onscreen keyboard.

When entering a new password, it does offer the option to select an entry from the passwords stored in ""App & Website Passwords"" under ""Accounts & Passwords"" in Settings. You can make an entry there and give that a strong password, and then fill it that way in the McDonalds password screens, but it tends to mess up overwrite the existing password field when you are trying to enter the new password.

With sufficient fiddling you can get this to work. But it is annoying and tedious and there is no good reason to have to do this whatsoever. Just let is paste.

753,2021-05-15 19:02:28,False,Update Issues,2,"There are some issues with the latest design that have come up recently that I hope will be fixed soon. 

1. You cannot place an order in advance. The order literally does not process until you are in the restaurant. That means you have to wait in the restaurant for your meal to be made even if you created the order well ahead of time.

2. You have to make sure to bring the same device to the restaurant after setting up the order. Then, you have to have location services enabled or else you get an error when you try to place it. If your device doesn‚Äôt have data then you need to log on to the wifi at the restaurant (luckily most McDonald‚Äôs have wifi). This process feels overcomplicated and led to several snags as I tried to get my order in the system.

I can see why these updates may have felt like a good idea (food not getting cold, not accidentally ordering at the wrong location), but there should be an option to place the order for immediate pickup so it‚Äôs ready when you arrive and doesn‚Äôt require location sharing. As I said, the updates seem fairly new and will hopefully be ironed out.",Henry49371649,,McDonalds

It‚Äôs just a faster way to order than the drive through or going inside and waiting in line. Still good, but it would be nice if you could order, and they would just have it ready for you.

A developer has commented back saying they do this to make sure the order is fresh. However, if you are in a hurry in the mornings like I am, and want breakfast, maybe it would be smarter to get DoorDash or Grubhub and order pickup from the restaurant. Then it would be waiting for you.

The problem arises when you order something with the app from a particular location and they don‚Äôt have it available. Often you are still charged for it and won‚Äôt find out they don‚Äôt have the item until pickup. 
If you ask for a refund, originally they told you to dispute the charge with your bank or card company, because they won‚Äôt do it. 
Now, you are told to call McDonalds corporate, and file a refund request with the location‚Äôs owner. This has happened to me twice. Seven months later, I‚Äôm still waiting for my refund, I call corporate a couple times a month to see if I can get my money back. I‚Äôm pretty sure I will never see that money again.

It would be more efficient to simply send the order and they can push it to processing once you arrive. Especially since two of your locations in my town are in cell dead zones. If you cannot get the app to load in the drive thru you cannot receive the order you already paid for.

Also, you do not need to claw at all of my data to provide app functionality.

‚Äî Let users edit their account information, or update it from Facebook at least time to time. Some people change names and email addresses.

‚Äî Make the app less data-intense. Use caching and other means (such as PWA) instead of complaining about internet connection.

This will do for starters. The rest will come if you simplify the feedback ;-)

Then, once you add an item to your order, a yellow ribbon offering to take you to checkout covers the search bar. You can‚Äôt swipe it away, because if you touch it at all, it takes you to checkout.

Lastly, the app has technical difficulties all the time. I get McDonald‚Äôs maybe twice a month, and the frequency of these issues bothers me.

The store by my work does fine. but the other two don‚Äôt, I had one store double charge me with no promise of a return (which I took up with the manager), the second I ordered from twice, both times it was over fifteen minutes before I walked in and wondered what happened. 

So my advice to McDonalds would be to retrain stores or, maybe add a tracker like Dominos where you can track progress of your order while you wait.",rjf1231,,McDonalds

The app typically works well. The deals seem to be slim going into 2019, though. The Buy one sandwich get one for $1 will be missed. 

McDonald‚Äôs is getting as slow as In n out when it comes to drive-thru and in store service. Even if I check in 100ft away they are SLOW! Expand check in area to perhaps a mile or 1/2 mile. Allow order to be sent to the kitchen immediately so when we arrive there is a higher chance of it being ready. Starbucks, Taco Bell and Jack In The Box allow this. They already do this with Uber Eats orders let us do it, McDonald‚Äôs! 

 In store pick up and curbside place your mobile order with the rest of their dine-in orders. They prioritize drive-thru orders then dine in and curbside and typically do not have the staff to expedite to curbside faster than drive-thru.

1364,2021-05-07 19:37:07,True,Very Poorly Done,1,"This is just stupid. When you try to set up an account, copy/paste is disabled for the password fields. So you can‚Äôt generate a good password with a password manager like PWSafe or 1Password and then paste it in; you have to type the whole bloody thing by hand. 

 Also, they limit your password to 12 characters, that‚Äôs entirely unacceptable. Safari generates 20-character passwords. And nobody in their right mind imposes a maximum length limit on their user‚Äôs passwords. Hello? Equifax? Target? Any awareness at all of the major breaches that have occurred over the past few years? 

 And if you go to the trouble of typing in a decent password, and it‚Äôs too long, you can‚Äôt just backspace from the end to remove the extra characters, because some genius decided that a single backspace should delete everything you just typed in. 

If you want me to use your app, you need to make it a lot less painful to set up an account with a reasonably safe password.

The team really needs to take a mobile-first approach and study how to create an easy mobile app. There are sooo many barriers to entry and order. It is asked whether signing in or signing up to confirm via email which requires the user to exit the app to check email. The email then takes 3+ mins to arrive - this needs to be NRT if you really need ppl to validate via email. My recommendation would be to skip the email step altogether and find a way to keep ppl in the app. Also the onboarding flow and payment flow don't feel mobile-first and requires a lot of entry from the user.

Nice app. Not sure we actually need it.

Update to developer response. 

I understand the strategy of waiting till you arrive to begin preparing the food. This really does make sense. I suppose the app is an additional vehicle to order your food.

But recently (early September 2021) it started doing something completely unacceptable: it's changing the restaurant for the pick-up during the ordering, with one case where it changed it after the payment was completed.

This is unacceptable because nobody can divert to going to a different district to pick up an order. To make things even worse, every time this happens, the restaurant I actually want to get the order from is not showing up anymore. If there is a problem with the restaurant, cancel the the order! Or at least show a message telling the user that the restaurant chosen is not available.

And to finish the circus... Getting a refund involves sending screenshots of the failed order on WeChat and waiting hours or days for the refund to go through.

This used to be  great app, but now it's unusable.  Why?  Closed orders never close.  You can't place a new order, because the old order from 3 days ago is still open.  Yes, the one you paid for and picked up.  The one that's closed.  

But on the McDonald's app, old orders never close.  They hang around like ghosts of breakfasts past, and the only way to exorcise them is to uninstall the app.  McDonalds technical support is useless - after reading you some boilerplate, they say the exact same thing: remove the app and reinstall.

Yes, you heard that right: closing the app?  No help. Restarting your iPhone?  Doesn't do a thing.  The only way to clear out a completed order is to reinstall the app, completely.  This is a terrible situation, because it now makes the app unusable, since it now only works one time per order.  Yes, the app is now disposable because it's so broken.",+AB+,,McDonalds

App often thinks you still haven‚Äôt picked up a previous order, forcing you to ‚Äúcancel‚Äù the fulfilled order before you can create a new order.

App gives the choice of going inside to ‚Äútake away‚Äù your order when you actually cannot do this.

Then the agent read something claiming McDonalds wants their customers to have confidence using their ap and then said they have no way to refund me even though they knew I was overcharged.
