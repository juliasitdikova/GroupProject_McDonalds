0,Convinient and has rewards,False,Godspeed2302,2020-12-05 19:09:04,5,"I used this app a lot for the rewards program, and now I use the mobile ordering even more since COVID restrictions in my town. You can select all items from the menu and indicate the specific bread, meat, toppings and sauces. I love how you can even indicate whether you want the regular amount or if you‚Äôd rather have more of a topping or less of the amount. You can also add on ‚Äú make it a meal‚Äù or side items individually. It is great that after you make an item you can select it as a favorite and put a name on it. This makes it easier the next time you are ordering for a family you just go to your favorites and you can find all your items already built to suit for each person. Additionally, you automatically earn points toward your reward tokens with later turn into cash rewards toward your purchase. The only downside the the rewards is that they do expire so don‚Äôt forget to use them. Last perk...well you can skip the line of course. It indicates what time your order will be ready and you can skip the line and go to the register to pick it up. Your all done because you already payed online. Great app!",,Subway
1,Not great...,False,csfrost1986,2020-12-13 22:54:17,2,"Especially compared to the competition (places like Taco Bell, Sonic, Pizza Hut, and Starbucks, which all have excellent apps), I find this app to be buggy and inconvenient. Adding toppings and sauces to subs is more cumbersome than it should be and I usually experience a lag when trying to remove toppings. The options online often don‚Äôt match up with the store. Salt apparently isn‚Äôt an option using the app, although pepper is? Maybe the issues lie with my local Subway‚Äôs inventory, but I also can‚Äôt select chip options that I know they have in store. There‚Äôs no way to specify what kind of fountain drink you want if you add it as a stand-alone item (can only specify if it‚Äôs part of a meal). As a result, I have to use the special request section to correct my order since it isn‚Äôt accurate and even then I just end up having to grab everything myself when I get to the store. Also, ‚ÄòMake it a meal?‚Äô shows up for subs but not for personal pizzas, even though every Subway I‚Äôve ever gone to offers up the option of making my pizza a meal. Had to try adding my credit card about 4 times before it finally saved it (even though I didn‚Äôt change any info  from the first attempt to the last... it was just being buggy). Buggy and slow when trying to remove items from the cart. Finally, it‚Äôs probably human error somewhere in the process, but the tracker often won‚Äôt register that I‚Äôve picked up my order, so I‚Äôll see a reminder on the app homepage saying I have an order ready.",,Subway
2,‚ÄúJust wait a hot minute‚Äù says the girl who‚Ä¶,False,Maxswiggy,2021-12-31 01:22:42,3,"So I already had problems from the start of my desire to order my subway sandwiches from one store for curbside pickup and was told when I called there that they had to cancel my order because Covid showed up with two of their staff and they couldn‚Äôt give me my order. I totally get that and was sorry to hear they were affected and pray they‚Äôll get through it unscathed. So I asked if they could forward it to another store and they said know. So I placed an order at another store on my way home. When I got there there was no one in the store and the young man started my order from what I could tell and completed it and put it to the side because a family walked in along with a female employee. I‚Äôm in parking lot watching this. So she joins him to help with family order but I‚Äôm wanted to get going tsp I called to ask about my order and she answered the phone. I told her I was ready for my order to pickup. She said, ‚ÄúJust wait a hot minute‚Äù and proceeded to hang up on me. I feel I had ordered way before the family walked in and should have mine completed and delivered first before starting in another. Then I get home and my sandwiches were not prepared according to what I had ordered. Very disappointed. Don‚Äôt appreciate the disrespect either. I was nice when I called, didn‚Äôt deserve it. Won‚Äôt go there again!",,Subway
3,A beginner,False,Keely Maltby,2021-06-21 04:23:53,4,"I just signed up and it was pretty painless. I‚Äôm typically very frustrated by the time I‚Äôm finished unless I Chuck my Phone out the window before I‚Äôm done.   The application/ sign up process was  easy. Ordering sandwiches was a step by step process and the pictures make it easy to follow. I forgot to order my choice of cheese but in the checkout yiu have one last chance to add or subtract items. Also the locations chapter was easy to follow and subway allows Apple Maps so I‚Äôm not forced to download another map app I don‚Äôt necessarily want, thanks for that consideration. To summarize; my lengthy review; signing up is breeze  just read the instructions & follow the steps. If you‚Äôre not on your own turf Locating a store is a cinch if you know where you are. If you don‚Äôt know where you are it‚Äôs likely you need more than a sandwich.  I found this app to be problem free. Besides there really isn‚Äôt a Cadillac problem that can‚Äôt be fixed with a stomach full of Subway is there?  Slow your roll (wheat , Italian, or artisan lol couldn‚Äôt help it ) slow your roll you‚Äôll be unwrapping that delicious 12 inches of Yummy in no time. Cant eat the whole thing? Wrap in some plastic and BAM! Lunch tomorrow cuz its stays fresh even overnight. You‚Äôre welcome,  k&g Henson Murrieta Ca",,Subway
4,Absolute Garbage,False,MJSinNEW,2020-04-16 01:15:27,1,"Placed an order at 5:20pm on the app for pickup at the Menominee, MI Subway. Completed the transaction and it told me it would be ready for pickup at 8:20pm. Three hours?!!! Called the store 20 minutes later to see if was really going to take that long. They haven‚Äôt gotten the order! She said it usually takes 15 minutes for the store to receive it. So they should have already gotten it. She said once they received the order that they would have it ready in 15-20 minutes. I called back in 25 minutes and they still hadn‚Äôt received the order! She asked me to give her my order over the phone and they would make it right away. I went to the store 20 minutes later and showed the woman my phone with the order details which show date, time, order number, store number, location, items ordered, amount paid, method of payment. Everything to prove it‚Äôs legit. I appreciate the employees willingness to resolve things, but the app is COMPLETE GARBAGE!!! The store had no way to look up my order, no way to cancel the order, and no familiarity with the app itself. They made my verbal order with one error, by forgetting to put bacon on my steak & bacon sub, which is a little frustrating. The app far outweighed the missing bacon in terms of visceral frustration. And on the Subway website under the Contact Us section, you don‚Äôt have an option to choose app problems or feedback. I‚Äôd rate the app zero stars if that was an option.",,Subway
5,Very buggy,False,Gottliebfan,2021-04-16 03:51:27,5,"Are used this app about three days ago and it worked fine. I was able to go to my recent orders and replace the same order without any problems. Then I upgraded the app. When I tried to use it today I was unable to re-order one of my orders from previous days. I had to start an order from scratch. When I got to the subway restaurant about 20 minutes after placing my order, they could not find my order then they found his body had a hard time because they did not find my name on the order even though I had placed the order using my Subway account with my name on it. Now I am trying to test the app again and I get a screen that says I need to update it when I press the green update button at the bottom of the screen nothing happens. I went to the App Store to download the update but I am having the same problem. When I open the app, I get that same screen that says that an update is needed and it‚Äôs giving me an option to press the green buttonTo update, but that button is unresponsive. What is happening?",,Subway
6,Absolute waste of time of an app,False,Liam Allen,2020-08-28 05:28:40,1,"The app in itself is pretty good save the fact that it‚Äôs not crystal clear how to apply the deals to an existing order. However that‚Äôs not the reason why I‚Äôm writing to you. I just downloaded the subway app about a week ago, and I have used it four times so far. The first THREE orders had missing items and not just simple items I mean like the missing guacamole in the turkey bacon GUAC wrap. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è luckily we live in walking distance so I just walk back to fix the order. Now the fourth time is the kicker and it is pretty much the sole reason why I will never ever use your subway app again. I dialed in the order and it gives me the ready time of approx. 15 minutes. Totally fine. I show up at the approx. time and it‚Äôs one person who just showed up to their shift for that night and has no idea where my order is. He spots the ticket order on the counter and is confused why no one has taken care of it since it‚Äôs been 15-20 minutes since that ticket order has been ordered and PAID through your app. Apparently your (probably way underpaid minimum waged) prior shift employee grabbed the ticket, set it on the counter, and clocked out without even communicating to the next shift employee about it. I‚Äôm giving your app a one star not because your app is insufficient but because you failed to realize that you expect your franchise to employ competent persons to execute orders that is generally meticulous in nature.",,Subway
7,Simply doesn‚Äôt work!,False,Anita245,2019-10-03 16:02:24,1,"I would give a 0 star rating if I could. The app wouldn‚Äôt was not working at all about 1 month ago while visiting one of my local Subways to pick up a sandwich at the end of a long day! The clerk/server ringing up my purchase did his best to scan the App to apply/redeem my points to no avail. As I happen to carry the card that came before the App with me as well, he tried to swipe the card (which has always worked before) and the end results was a total lockout of my account with the message to contact Subway. I had to make the purchase without my points! I did contact Subway the next day and after several minutes, the customer service rep found the solution to my problem. Problem solved; hardly! Two weeks later, I went to buy three sandwiches at one of my local Subway locations. This time out, the App just kept spinning and spinning as if it was prepping to open. It never did! Thank goodness my old card worked this time out. A couple of days after, I tried to open the App at home just to see what would happen. It opened up without a hiccup. Gee Subway, I need the App to work when I am actually interested in ordering food, NOT when I am just sitting at home not interested in eating your food that day. I expect to have a helpful, functioning App at the time of purchase instead of a message to contact you guys, or to simply not have the App open at the moment of truth!

8,Useless app and terrible customer service,False,B3x3,2021-08-03 23:53:40,1,"I placed an app order at my local Subway Sunday evening at 8:40pm. Store hours online said they were open until 9pm and the app showed them available for taking orders. Placed an order and got a message from the app saying my card was charged, the order was confirmed and would be ready shortly. I went to the location (verified twice) and the store hours on the door said they closed at 8. No big deal, hours change, but then why did the app allow the order, confirm, and charge for it? 

So, I went in to the store today, showed them the order (which the app still lists as pending),  explained the issue, figuring since the order was shown as paid, they could simply make good on it now. I was told that they couldn‚Äôt make food for that order, that I would have to order again and dispute the previous charge with my bank!!  I just did and got my money back, thankfully. 

I also tried contacting Subway directly before my bank, but their 800 number would only tell me (by recording) to report app issues on the web site. Clicking ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in the app takes you to that same site, and the answer to ‚Äúhow to report an issue‚Äù on the site says to click ‚Äúcontact us‚Äù under ‚Äúhelp‚Äù in the app, but no such option exists. There‚Äôs literally only ‚Äúhelp‚Äù which takes you to the web site which says to report in the app‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..",,Subway
9,THIEF‚ÄôS NEVER AGAIN!!,False,DO NOT GET TERRIBLE TO DELETE,2022-01-06 16:24:03,1,"First I placed an ordered for delivery. Upon arrival I received one out of three sandwiches and the one I did get wasn‚Äôt correct at all. I looked to see if there was a way I could fix this through the app and there wasn‚Äôt. This was the beginning of my problems. I then called the store as directed by their page and was met with the most rude and incompetent person. She refused to cancel it/refund it saying there was nothing she could do. When I asked for a customer support number she said she didn‚Äôt know, when I ask okay how do we fix this? She stated in the most annoyed tone ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, I can‚Äôt do anything‚Äù when I asked for a manager she said I kid you not, ‚Äúoh I don‚Äôt know‚Äù are you serious? When asked for her NAME she said she didn‚Äôt know. Eventually I just hung up and was going to dispute it with my bank but she did call me back and suddenly was magically able to cancel the order. The second time I attempted to use the app, I placed an order on the app for pick up this time attempting to avoid the same issue, the order stated it went through and they where ‚Äúworking‚Äù on it. However when I arrived the place was completely empty and closed!!! Not a single employee in there. How the app allowed me to place an order is beyond me. I had to dispute the charge with my bank since I couldn‚Äôt even call and corporate is a joke. Over all screw subway, NEVER AGAIN.",,Subway
10,Where‚Äôs the Rewards,False,Ronwilt,2018-02-08 22:34:52,4,"The app is convenient when it works.  I say that because so often I go through the pains of buying online and I get to the end and get an error. This happens frequently. I resubmit, start over , etc. same stupid error message. And there is no one to call and ask for assistance. I keep the app current on my iPhone. The next day it may or may not work again. I also think going through the menu is slow and clumsy. 

I also try to get my order straight in advance so when I am ready and I hit the purchase button I know it will be fresh. This is typically the time I am hurried and do not want to step through the menu. But I still want Subway Fresh, right. But today something changed and when I went back to my order to submit payment it appeared to be missing. So I ordered all over again and then noticed I had two subs in the queue. So I had to figure out how to cancel one of them. My order changed slightly and I couldn‚Äôt tell which one I was canceling. 

So what is my reward for continuing to use the app and buy from Subway. There is none. No rewards for buying your subs 3-4 days a week. No extra discounts. No buy 4 get the 5th free. Nada. And I don‚Äôt expect anyone will respond to my input. So Surprise me, Subway.","{'id': 2576223, 'body': 'Hi there- we are here to help!

11,App crashed but still charged me,False,Mahler rocks,2022-01-06 21:21:45,1,"I placed my order in the app but when it came time to pay the app gave me an error message and asked me to try again. I did so. Then it gave me another error and said my cart had expired, create a new cart. I closed the app, relaunched the app, tried again and had the same problems. I finally gave up and called the store directly. After placing my order over the phone, I thought to check my email. Sure enough, there were two messages waiting for me confirming my orders from the app. I checked with my bank app and guess what? Subway had charged me three times! Two times from the app and once from the over the phone order. 

As I was looking at this information, the store called me back. Thankfully they noticed a duplicate order. What‚Äôs that you say? A single duplicate order? That‚Äôs right‚Ä¶ Only two of the three orders showed in their system. Some thing was definitely not working right. The store was only able to cancel one order and is going to wait an hour or two to see if the third one shows up in their system and will void it at that time. 

What a horribly, unreliable app. And for people who don‚Äôt catch the extra charges on their bank account right away, a horrible inconvenience to have to call the bank and try to prove that these charges should not have existed in the first place.",,Subway
12,Wish I could rate a zero,False,Akominiarek,2020-07-31 16:37:06,1,"I ordered and picked up an order though this app on 7/23 and didn‚Äôt seem to have any issues. Two hours later, the store called me to tel me that my order needed to be picked up! I had already done so! Much to my chagrin, there was a different order - two sandwiches instead of the three I ordered. I thought it would be simple and the store would cancel the order - NOPE!!! The manager said they didn‚Äôt get any money for the sandwiches and they could not stop the pending charges or reverse them so I would have to submit an online request for reimbursement because I used this app - but wait it gets better - I submitted my request that day and waited patiently for a response, but on the eighth day I called corporate. Corporate told me that they would do anything for me either and I had to take the time to dispute the charge with my own bank:/! I was told this subway is a franchise and therefore not part of the subway corporation?!?!?! Best part is I‚Äôm the only on that is out of luck - the franchise and the corporation still have my money!!!! The lack of support and customer service has been appalling.

Upon getting home, the app shows my order is ready for pickup so I call the store again.  They claim they still hadn‚Äôt received the order and that it must be an automated notification.  Three hours later I receive a call from said subway asking if I am going to pick up my order as it has been hours since it was ordered online. I tell the person they must be joking because I was there hours before trying to pick it up when they said it didn‚Äôt exist. It was apparently under my husband‚Äôs name somehow.  You would think they would have asked my husband if it could have been ordered under his name somehow but neither of us even thought about that.

For some ridiculous reason it does not allow you to pay with a remaining gift card balance and a credit card to cover the difference.

Hours after getting my sandwich I went in the app and it read,‚Äù it wasn‚Äôt  able to add my points‚Äù, so I checked my email to make sure it confirmed that I purchased it. In which they sent my confirmation, but the app continued to say an error occurred while trying to retrieve points. So I clicked the scan icon to see if anything would happen, and once I clicked it. Actually every time I clicked the icon the subway app would disappear, and it would go to my home page. So I checked my WiFi to see if that was the problem which it wasn‚Äôt, and then I logged out. Once I did that it, the app said its performing maintenance on their registration process. That‚Äôs just makes me upset because I don‚Äôt know if this maintenance is going to cancel the  points I already have and on top of that I never got my points from the order I just purchased. There is no history of my purchase on the app (before logging out) because there was an error. So if I could be helped out I would really appreciate it.

Im only leaving this review based of a recent experience I had using the app. I ordered a sandwich from a local subway shop, I got a call almost instantly saying that they were out of almost everything, at that point why they were still even open I dont know, so I obviously didnt want any other sandwich of the two bad options I had with what they had left, so I asked them to cancel the order, and the employee said there is no way to cancel the order on their end‚Ä¶‚Ä¶so what are we suppose to do when this happens???

20,Subway support helped solve accessibility issue with VoiceOver! Might have been iOS version issue.,True,Brl.Dots,2020-01-24 09:44:27,5,"THANKS to Subway phone tech support, we figured out what the issue might have been.
I'm running iOS version 12.4.1 on my iPhone. I was impressed when the support person with whom I spoke actually knew how to turn on VoiceOver, and try the app using it with his phone. He was running iOS 13.3, and I heard the app working as it should, getting past the first screen. He also had a coworker try it with iOS 13.3 on an older phone.
So, we arrived at the solution that I would update my iPod Touch, and see if I can get past the first screen with it. When I tried that the next day, sure enough, it did work!
And now, for whatever reason, it's again working on my phone at iOS 12.4.1, too, when the other day, I could double tap until the cows come home, and it wouldn't go anywhere past the initial screen.
MANY THANKS Subway tech support! You've restored some of my faith in app developers and tech support people who actually have an interest in app accessibility!
THANK YOU AGAIN!

21,Always an issue,False,Fenomis,2021-04-22 19:05:57,2,"There is always always always an issue with this app. I know that there‚Äôs another bread available when I go in the store. It‚Äôs the 9 grain honey oat. I only saw that option once on the app. The buffalo sauce was unavailable for a couple of months (except for the buffalo chicken sandwich was the only way to get buffalo sauce on this app). That issue is fixed now. BUT NOW, I ordered today and there was no possible way to get the bread toasted. The toasted option wasn‚Äôt there. Only on the artisan flatbread was the only one with the toasted option. So on the ‚Äúspecial instructions ‚Äú I put the word TOASTED 3 times all in capital letters. And guess what, my sandwich was stone cold and not toasted at all. The egg whites came straight out of the refrigerator. I don‚Äôt want cold eggs. And it would be nice to have ALL of the seasonings available. Sometimes there‚Äôs only one available, sometimes there‚Äôs 4 available. Even if there‚Äôs 4 it still doesn‚Äôt display them all. There‚Äôs always an issue with this app. There were times I bought cookies and chips and I didn‚Äôt receive them. I don‚Äôt think I ever had a smooth experience with this app. I only still use it because I like subway.",,Subway
22,yeah no thanks,False,AvenP,2020-12-16 00:29:14,1,"app popped up with a message asking if I was ""enjoying"" It after using it for less than ten minutes. It took all of those ten minutes to get through the glitches so it would actually allow me to order, so I said no, I wasn't. The next pop-up was the most condescending ""Oh no! Do you want to tell us more?"" I've ever seen. I hit yes, thinking it would take me, like.... anywhere. Here, maybe? To a form that you can submit on their website or through their app (if you can get it to work long enough to find it)? 

Nope! It asked if I wanted to call them. The ONLY option it gives for feedback about a bad experience is calling and talking to someone on the phone. What year is it?? I get that it took them four years longer than any other fast food joint to actually have an app in the first place, but surely, *surely* they aren't only giving that option for frustrating experiences because they know very few people will actually call, right? That can't possibly be it. Sure, there is literally no reason to *only* have a phone option in the year 2020 for a major fast food joint, but.... okay, there's no but. So hey, congrats! A one star review and a rant, just like you really didn't want me to ‚ó°Ãà",,Subway
23,Disappointing,False,jacksonti9398,2020-07-27 20:55:11,2,"I‚Äôm a big fan of eating at Subway because of how much you can customize things. This app doesn‚Äôt let you do that nearly as much. Items like the Steak & Cheese don‚Äôt give you the option to select a Footlong, which is frustrating because Subway currently has an offer of $5 footlongs if you order 2 on the app, which this prevents me from taking advantage of. Entire menu items are completely missing from the menu as well, like the Ham and Turkey sandwich. Also, other ingredients, such as bell peppers, are completely missing from the Customization page; but when I go into the local store in-person, they have them in stock. 

I also sometimes like to add other meats to existing menu items, but the app only allows Pepperoni, Bacon, or Guacamole as custom add-ons. I know from working at a Subway restaurant in the past that it is just as easy to add items like Salami, or almost anything else, onto an order; yet the app doesn‚Äôt allow that.

All in all, these issues with this app have prevented me from being able to order what I want from Subway via app. The Subway website has all the same problems. During this pandemic, that means I cannot order from Subway at all.",,Subway

Called the bank and found out that they charged us for the order. 10 minutes later Subway voided the order from the bank too, nothing to do with the bank. Had to then get in a long line and re order our large order. What a waste of time! Called the 800 number they don‚Äôt care and told me it‚Äôs on the specific store side. All I got back from the store was a already formed email that they send to every customer who has an issue. Not ever using this app again. Waste of my time! No one cared to tell me how this can be avoided again or if I use the app again if this would happen again?!?

25,quite literally the worst app i have ever used,False,emiked,2020-08-01 15:02:59,1,"where to even start? i have no idea how the app has 4.8/5 starts because every time i try to use this app, i run in to NUMEROUS issues to the point that i give up and usually end up getting food elsewhere. it‚Äôs slow, and doesn‚Äôt even work half of the time. when it does, i encounter error after error. it asks you to confirm your order location approx FOUR separate times during the ordering process, you cant use a gift card unless the balance covers the entire order total (cant split between a debit/credit card and gift card - so dumb) and editing your sandwich is so lengthy and unnecessarily difficult. setting a payment method is a nightmare and again, i don't think you can even use a gift card loaded to the app in person at a subway unless it covers the whole total???? the app also shows pop up ads CONSTANTLY  throughout the ordering process which is just annoying and a nuisance. takes you to the final order page after every item you add - also annoying - and it‚Äôs so tedious to try and edit an item added to your cart. overall the WORST experience i have had using any app ever, not just food wise. do better subway.",,Subway
26,Worst app ever!!,False,Brelove13,2020-05-13 01:44:47,1,"I placed an order on the app an hour in advance and realized that it was at the wrong location. The app doesn‚Äôt allow you to cancel an order, to do so you would have to contact the restaurant. I called them and they said that they haven‚Äôt received the order and they hung up in my face. I called back and the guy said that he checked the orders and mine hadn‚Äôt shown up. He asked what time i placer the order for and I told him 8:15pm as it was about 7:20 pm. He said (with the rudest attitude) to call back closer to the order time to cancel. I said I would and I placed an order for the correct location. I called them at 8:05 pm and nobody answered. I called them at least five more times with no answer. I decided to go to the restaurant and handle it inside. It took 30 minutes to get to the front of the line and the girl couldn‚Äôt do anything. I was extremely late for work waiting on that line and I HAD to take the sandwiches. They were prepared incorrectly on top of all of it and I still had to pick up my order at the correct location. I‚Äôve never know an app not to have a cancel option. This is ridiculous and I want a refund. Never using this app again. It was a complete waste of time and money",,Subway
27,Broken,False,FLBoy Suave,2020-06-19 02:10:12,1,"I tried to place an order with a coupon. Turns out the coupons aren‚Äôt accepted at my local subway. That‚Äôs fine. But the order said it‚Äôd be ready for pickup at 9:30 PM which was HOURS after I placed the order. I called the Subway and told them I wanted to cancel that order and that the app said it would be ready at 9:30 PM. They said no order came in. So I said that‚Äôs fine but I don‚Äôt want the order if it does. Unfortunately there‚Äôs NO way to cancel orders from the app. Here I am at 10 pm getting angry calls from Subway saying hey come pick up your food, we‚Äôre trying to close. I explained to them that I called and canceled hours ago but no order was showing. So when my order finally showed up they made it and charged me. I told her I wanted a refund which at first she wasn‚Äôt going to give me. Eventually they decided to refund my money. I‚Äôm not mad at the subway because it‚Äôs the app‚Äôs fault for not having a cancel option. I imagine after hours they had done forgotten about my phone call and fulfilled the order not thinking anything of it. Either way, I‚Äôm deleting the app. If my local Subway isn‚Äôt going to utilize the coupons advertised, there‚Äôs no real incentive to keep it anyways.",,Subway

So I went through the website and it didn‚Äôt even have an option for any issues of such, cancellations. So I had to just try and contact them and send them a note and still haven‚Äôt received anything. So now I most about $20 and no food even.

Food items are still listed even though they have been removed from the menu. 
Also, local store inventory is not in sync between corporation so the app doesn‚Äôt know if they have items in stock or are temporarily out... so if your lucky you will get a call from the store location telling you they don‚Äôt have what you ordered or the items not on their menu and you have to give them a replacement order over the phone on the spot. Or you get to the store expecting to pick up your order only to find out they don‚Äôt have the items and you need to make your sandwich/s anyway. 
And... that doesn‚Äôt take into account the possibility the price of what you then order for replacement is a lower price then the original order but that‚Äôs just to bad, because you already paid the price for the higher items so you‚Äôre expected to ‚Äúeat‚Äù the difference in price because you ordered and paid online on the app!

Ordered a sandwich through the app for a restaurant that was supposed to be open until midnight (according to the app), received my confirmation email, arrived at the store at 10:55 and it was very clearly closed (with hours posted as open until 11:30pm). Couldn‚Äôt cancel the order since the only way to do that is by calling the restaurant who obviously didn‚Äôt pick up. Only customer service contact is a form, so filled it out explaining what had occurred and asking for confirmation I wouldn‚Äôt be charged. Four days later my credit card has been charged and I have no response from customer service, looks like I‚Äôm going to have to deal with this through my credit card company.

32,"Broken, Buggy, and just plain Bad",False,Lou BP,2019-11-23 11:45:39,1,"The Subway app has updated and changed for the worse. First is that the app makes it ridiculously difficult to select or change the store your ordering from. Sometimes even refusing to do so after you select the store you want, and given the no refund policy it can hurt having the sandwich  you payed for in the wrong place. Second the app constantly runs into errors having once completely ignore my order, after I had ordered it and everything. 
Lastly the app charged me TWICE for one sandwich. The app order history says one sandwich, when I picked it up I had one sandwich, but my transaction history on my bank account has two separate identical charges for the sandwich. I am currently trying to see if this can be resolved but be warned.
With the above said there are more rough unintuitive parts of the app like accessing your cart or editing it bar those problems don‚Äôt bring actual consequences like misplaced, unplaced, or double charge orders like the other problems.
Before the update the app didn‚Äôt have these frustrating problems but now I just say, call the store ahead instead and save yourself the trouble.","{'id': 12777066, 'body': ""We appreciate you sharing your feedback, and are always looking for ways to enhance the mobile app experience for our guests.

33,No cancel feature,False,Cof072022,2022-07-15 13:12:05,2,"For what it is, it‚Äôs ok. It‚Äôs slow to work and has shut me out several times where I had to start over. But that isn‚Äôt my issue with this app or why I gave it such a low rating. 
   On April 24, 2022 I made an order and as soon as I hit the order button I realized it was for the wrong town. I IMMEDIATELY tried to cancel it through the app, no button. So I called the store before they even pulled out the bread. The associate on the phone assured me they would take care of my refund and they did not make my order. It has now been 11 weeks, several attempts through the website contact and follow up emails with a Shawn James the supposed General Manager of this branch and NOTHING! He even assured me himself he would get my refund in the mail. I finally emailed him and told him this company obviously doesn‚Äôt care about their customers and I was done exhausting myself to follow-up with his so called promises.

34,No longer usable for online pickup,False,HomeStyleBeans,2022-01-19 02:28:05,2,"I used to eat at Subway every week at least twice. The app was extremely convenient for me to order and it be in the process of being made while I was driving over to the location.
Eventually, every attempt to make an online pickup order for the past year has not worked for me. Oftentimes, it simply denies submitting my order right as I go to check out. When this first started happening, I would just submit my order over the phone. When they made it against company policy to put in phone orders for pick up, I stopped going because I was deterred of standing in line during the pandemic.
I went months not visiting subway because of these issues. I just tried the app for the first time again today, and it failed to complete. Thankfully the cashier allowed a phone order this time. 
Hopefully they figure out the app issues eventually. With how Covid is, if I am denied doing over the phone, I'll have to go back to not even going here. I really love subway, and I want them to sustain through this pandemic.",,Subway

I literally go to subway seven days a week and accumulate a ton of points and redeem them one at a time when they‚Äôre about the expire. I‚Äôve used this app since it came out two years ago.

If you manage to get an order placed you then find That it was a waste of time because regardless of what is entered into the app you will be picking up what the sandwich maker wishes to prepare rather than what you ordered and then you will be told that is your fault. You have to step them through making the sandwich. They have an aversion to not toasting a sub. I ordered 4 subs, none toasted as that is an option in the app. 3 of the 4 sandwiches were toasted and the one that was not was in the same bag steaming and getting soggy. They actually told me they always toast the subs and threw their hands up when I insisted that I ordered exactly what i wanted - app has choice of toasted or not, and I ordered not toasted, but that seems wrong to them.

Why not develop that same system with Subway instead of putting the model and color of your car and saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Here.‚Äù Because in reality, by putting the curbside number on the app, they ( Subway employee ) know you are here waiting anyways.  Nobody cares about the make, model,  and color of the car when ordering food. It‚Äôs all about getting the order to the right person in a timely manner.

So I needlessly doubled my order and received 4 foot-longs instead of 2.  None of those darn things are toasted either.

Secondly, the stores I frequent are poorly run.

The other employee there did look at my phone and verified that there was in fact a 3rd sandwich in my order but ended up having to pay for it out of pocket himself?!?!

45,App needs work - NOT like ordering at a Subway shop,False,Syracuse R,2021-10-10 01:57:40,1,"This review involves the remote ordering and delivery on the app. The process is very poorly designed. I expected that the app would be like ordering at a Subway shop but it is not. You cannot order things on the app like you can in a store - they restrict the available vegetable toppings and actually don‚Äôt allow you to add certain topping that you can normally just choose and point too. Secondly it‚Äôs a very limited choice of condiments. No Chipotle or Sriracha. No Ranch?!? Seriously. Items normally available at the store (like the toppings and chips that I know were at that Subway) were not available. Also at payment time it crashed and told me my payment didn‚Äôt go through, and I would have to clear the cart and start over, but it still charged my card. And the order did go through. But if I had redone it as the app said, I would have had 2 meals...Very disappointed in the app and it‚Äôs lack of selection to be able to create the sandwich I want. That‚Äôs exactly why I appreciate Subway. Don‚Äôt like the app at all.",,Subway
46,Awful experience,False,Kelanix,2019-12-14 21:59:23,1,"I downloaded the app because the regular online ordering failed miserably. And it was even worse. It took me 10 minutes to find the fine print to add/customize normal toppings. Next, the site kept telling me my local store was closed, when a phone call verified it was very much open. Next, after that ordeal,  despite trying three(!!) methods of payment, every one failed, returned a random error and then I‚Äôd get logged out, forcing me to log back in and do it all over again. Same problems each time. Lastly, all the hmHelp or Contact Us links threw up a 404 Not Found error.  Wonderful. 

So I download the app. At least this one shows my local store as open, but while attempting to build a sandwich, I notice that if you try to add multiple toppings from a category (i.e. cheese), it removes the one you‚Äôve already selected.  So if you want cheddar and swiss on that sub, you‚Äôre apparently out of luck. I gave up after this. So who knows whether the app would have had the same payment glitch. I won‚Äôt be finding out anytime soon. Tonight just became pizza night.

Also, don‚Äôt add a gift card to your payments because if it isn‚Äôt enough to cover the tab it doesn‚Äôt allow you to use an additional payment option to finish the order. So, if your gift card is worth $10 but your order is $11, you can‚Äôt use your gift card at all. A waste.

I‚Äôm not talking about catering, I don‚Äôt need to order dozens of subs for some event. I just want to order a few subs for lunch and get them delivered to me while I continue working the whole time. Is there a reason why only California seems to deliver for individual orders?
Also, on both apps you cannot make any special requests except through notes. Yet 80% of the time the workers do not see the notes. So I have no way to order multiple cheeses with the app, I can‚Äôt ask for a little extra toasting (since the breakfast sandwiches are always, at every location, still cold with normal toasting).

The way this app walks you through ordering is very intuitive and actually fun. Pay through the app. Then, just walk in the store and pick up. Easy and quick. And if you do the traditional in-store order, having both rewards card and payment method in the app puts everything in one easy place. But if you want to pay cash or a method not in your account, you can do that, too. The only thing I don‚Äôt like is it only gives four protein options for the kids meal. If you want to get one that‚Äôs not built in, like tuna, it won‚Äôt let you customize the protein, and you‚Äôll still have to order in store. Could use a tad more flexibility in that respect.

We had to leave because we could not wait any longer. The employee was fixing customers sandwiches who had just walked in the store instead of fixing our online order that had been placed over 20 minutes before. 

For a refund, we were told by the employee that they could not refund our money and that we had to call customer service. But the employee did not have the customer service number. 

There is also no way to request a refund on the app or anything to troubleshoot should an order go unfulfilled. 

When we finally found a number using Google (because the Subway website does not list a number), we got an automated message saying that app order issues can only be handled by sending a message through the website. Which is ridiculous. 

Perhaps a troubleshooting tab on the app. Or a way to request a refund through the app. Anything but having to go to your website and click through to find the right form. 

We did submit an inquiry on the website. Five days later, no response. And certainly no refund. 

An overall horrible experience. We just wanted food on time. Or perhaps an easy way to get our money back when the store failed to get the order ready on time. The app, the website, and any resemblance of customer service from Subway all failed.",,Subway

2) the scanning at purchase for payment and reward points is unreliable.  The interface given the cashier to use a linked credit card must be clumsy because I often have to rescan multiple times. This may be a training issue, a human interface design issue and/or a technical problem. I can‚Äôt tell from my side of the counter. But it is a problem.

3) the thin ribbon entitled ‚Äúshow card‚Äù is above the screen horizon and harder to find than necessary.

But i thought to myself that the app will probably let you order ahead and it doesn't. It also doesn't let you order as a guest. 1/5 stars because you tried and i‚Äôm sure its hard to keep up an app but you're a big company you should do better for customers and your employees. I say employees as well because i read a review that its been hard for stores to get orders from online/from the app. Maybe take those options away for a while and figure out how to make it better for your employees? Apps are very convenient but not when they aren't working.,,Subway

Their employees don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs being advertised. They just pick and choose which locations will actually give you a discount and you have to take the time just to track it down if it even does exist.

So I have to rely on going to my history. Problem is they don‚Äôt give you any information on the summary screen about the details of the orders are so you constantly have to close and open each one to see if that‚Äôs the one that you would like to re-order. It also will not let you use your rewards and less you start from scratch on the order. So it takes away the convenience. And when I tried to place my order from scratch for a breakfast sandwich it will not let me choose a white eggs or mozzarella cheese I am stuck with the standard items and then I have to make all kinds of notes in the comments so they will even know what to make. It went from a nice app to a nightmare. I also find that text I get on deals I cannot use through the app so I have no way of applying the deal to my order.

When my order arrived, half of one of the footlongs was missing and the remaining 6 inch had been crudely rewrapped. I‚Äôve never had an issue with the store and it genuinely appears that the delivery driver just chose to take half of a foot long and attempted to badly rewrap the rest. When I called the store, they said there was nothing they could do other than remake the order and have me go to the store to pick it up since they can‚Äôt put in complains about the delivery drivers either or do anything else about it. If delivery is going to continue to be an option through the app, there also needs to be a way to rate and place complaints about the delivery drivers.

My only criticism is the dressings selection.  If you order a salad. there is no where to add a salad dressing, such as fat free Italian. I am only left with the comments area to ask for a Italian dressing.  And most of the time the people at the subway location don't even read them.  I always get asked at the window or register, ‚ÄúDid you want any dressing?  I tell them,‚ÄùI wrote it in the comment area!‚Äù Their response,‚Äù Oh we never see or read that area.‚Äù.   OH BOY... sad.

I think all dressings should be listed for selection. Yea you get the normal selections mayo, mustard, red wine vinegar..etc... but not any of the other choices. I hope the developer reads this comment / review.  And seriously takes this request enhancement under consideration.

1) orders are rarely ready by the time estimated. Usually it‚Äôs another 5 to 10 minutes or more. Staff do not appear concerned about this. Of course they can be busy, but what good is a time statement if it‚Äôs consistently missed?

2) app does not refund missing items. I added avocado today, but the store was out. The store and app have no way to remove that charge. They offered to give me cookies or a bottle of water, but I didn‚Äôt want any of those. 

3) ingredients are often omitted. We ordered a tuna sandwich a few months back. Picked it up, drove to a picnic spot, and discovered the sandwich had no tuna. Today a BMT was missing the pepperoni. No indication the staff realized the omission. There‚Äôs no way to report problems or request a refund. 

4) favorites are often useless. If you try to order a favorite, but that store doesn‚Äôt have a particular ingredient in the favorite, it won‚Äôt let you add it. It won‚Äôt tell you what is unavailable. Only choices are ‚ÄúFind another location‚Äù and ‚ÄúContinue‚Äù‚Äîwhich skips adding the sandwich and returns you to the main menu.

So I went and took out the cash from my account because they guaranteed me that the money would not actually go through. So I paid in cash and this morning my account is now negative with a $25 over draft fee and soon to be more overdraft fees because I have other things coming out of my account. There is no number or email or anything to contact someone to get my money back even though the people at the subway store I ordered from said there was. All they can say is they have nothing to do with the app and I can contact someone on the app. But I can‚Äôt and now this little mistake is gonna cost me $100 in overdraft fees. That‚Äôs RIDICULOUS.

I used about $10 that day of the $25 gift card. About a month afterward, I got an email from Subway about a visit at a Texas location asking for my feedback (I live in Illinois). I immediately created a ticket with customer service through the Subway website (because to ‚Äúbetter serve‚Äù customers, you can no longer call them). I have still not heard back from them. I then decide to call the phone number listed on my credit card statement who was only able to redirect me back to Subway by ‚Äúraising‚Äù the issue. The gift card currently has less than $1 because of the fraud that occurred by someone using the digital gift card at a Texas location.

most of us not are app experts, but all of us have enough apps to have an opinion regarding the difference between good app practices, critical app practices and annoying app practices. Subway continues to fall into the latter - you are not a banking app and if you have to force updates to patch critical errors (at every update) then perhaps you need new developers who don‚Äôt leave our data at risk every time a new version becomes available.

They were also concerned that the order was never submitted to them from the delivery app.  

So, because this was inconvenient for both me and the employees, I‚Äôm rating it a 1, and will be deleting this useless app.  

When I use an app, I expect it to work, and I expect it to communicate to the restaurant it says it does.   This does neither.  The employees were great, and made up for the poor quality of this app.",,Subway

The first time wasn‚Äôt a big deal because there weren‚Äôt any coupons but today you had the promo for the buy one get one for $1. Right after I hit the second sandwich the app closed and when I reopened it the order was submitted before I was able to add on my other two footlongs. Called the store and they couldn‚Äôt understand why I was upset and told me just to add on the other sandwiches with another app order with the coupon but the coupon is gone. They kept telling me it would work but it wasn‚Äôt showing up on my end and I wasn‚Äôt going to place an order and be charged something different. This is my only frustration with the app I love the deals I don‚Äôt know why this has happened twice now. And I usually only treat my kids to subway if we have app deals so if this can‚Äôt be resolved well unfortunately have to be done with subway.,,Subway

The only reason for 4 stars and not 5 is because the user experience could be better.

97,Zero accountability for mistakes,False,XSid,2022-03-13 11:53:39,1,"App gets the job done to place order, but no recourse for mistakes in those orders.  Order placed isn‚Äôt what is printed on receipts, everything is jumbled or revisioned leading to frequent mistakes in fulfillment.  This is a hollow shell of a useful app.  It exists only to take your money and leave you in the wind when they inevitably mess up your order.

The only way to contact customer service to report a problem is through a form on the website where they request your personal information which they share with to the local store, and have the store call you to say they‚Äôll fix it on the next order - no options for a credit or refund.  They literally want you to follow up on their mistakes by spending more money with them.

If you‚Äôre going to order subway you are better off using a delivery service instead of this app - at least they listen and respond to bad service by giving you back what you are owed.",,Subway
98,No turkey for a month???,False,M.

I loved that I could just grab my sandwiches and head out, plus the sandwich artists did a great job getting our order correct every time. Then, about a month ago, the app started saying the store was sold out of several options, including turkey. I tried placing my order at a different franchise, but turkey was sold out there too??? I finally realized that one of the sandwiches still being offered had turkey in it, so I doubt this is just a supply problem. It‚Äôs been over a month of not being able to use this app to order a turkey sandwich. Unfortunately, without the app, I just get lunch somewhere else because the store is too busy when I need to pick up lunch. I hope they fix it, but after a month I am losing hope.",,Subway

This app is now useless to us since we have 1 GF family member and the app doesn't list GF bread as a choice, even though our Subway offers it in the restaurant. Additionally, the updated version is nowhere near as easy to use as the original version. It crashes and is slow overall. 

Original: I love this Subway option! We used to avoid Subway with 3 kids because the lines are always long. Not anymore! This app lets us build our sandwiches quickly and easily and even pay ahead of time. We just show up, skip the massive line, and get handed our order. The fact that the options are limited for sides on the app is alleviated by the fact that they let you grab them at our Subway so I can still get the chips we want even though they don't show up on the app. This is a game-changer for us when we occasionally need to eat out and find a fast food option.

No more waiting in the long line in the drive through.

102,App not worth the time,False,Brighton Tn.,2021-05-20 17:05:05,1,"Have been using the app for a while now. In my opinion, the app is not worth the time. Very slow and too many steps involved to make an order. Most of the time you can just go to the store and order faster than using the app. Takes several minutes to go through all the steps to make an order then if you don‚Äôt remember to put your order in in advance the app turns into a 30 minute process over all. There are also frequent updates which tells you the app developer is figuring things out on the fly and constantly having to correct things. Constantly have new bugs with mine after every update like not attaching my name to the order and listing it as unknown confusing the restaurants I‚Äôm ordering at. Subway is convenient because of so many locations but I enjoy using the Lenny‚Äôs app when a restaurant is in the area I‚Äôm in, much better.

But the mapping to find a restaurant is terrible.  Yesterday I couldn‚Äôt get it to let go of one restaurant so that I could find a closer one.   Today it's claiming that the there are NO restaurants in several locations where I know they exist.  And using pictures without words for designing a sandwich seems like a good mulitcultural idea, but it is more difficult for me.  

And why can't I add spinach? My customer is my sandwich I want to add spinach

This is now six months after I wrote the above. I haven‚Äôt proved the app quite a bit. Now the only thing that is needed is to allow you to save a favorite sandwich.   currently the favorites are all associated with specific restaurants. I wander all over the place, and only want a favorite sandwich, not a favorite restaurant.",,Subway

I ordered for 4pm pickup and finished my storage unit 30 minutes early and am having to wait that 30 minutes for the order to be able to be prepared. Of course, I suggested looking at my app for the order and was refused, so that could just be someone who should not be in customer service at all! 
Regardless, the initial problem lays within your app! I‚Äôm sure you could take 5 minutes to figure out the 1s and 0s and make it happen on your next update of the app.

My only complaint is about the ""Deals"" feature. When you pick a deal, then pick a location, it should immediately tell the user if that location does not accept the deal. Instead, it allows the user to go through the entire ordering process before telling them at the end that the location chosen does not accept the deal. This would be tenable if it didn't force you to start the entire order completely over! If this one thing could be fixed, this app would be flawless. It really is a cool, well-built app overall.

It‚Äôs the side items like chips or drinks that are missing. (Not the apps fault). It happened today and the only way to report it is to call the restaurant that fulfilled the order. This turned out to be pointless because they don‚Äôt do refunds for missing items. You have to go to the store to pick up the missing items, which defeats the purpose of the delivery option. I was offered a voucher for free 6 inch for the mistake, but the only way to get the voucher is to go to the restaurant. Again, defeating the purpose of delivery.

I have a very limited lunch time and I would like to order in the mornings and schedule my pick up time but it will not let you. Furthermore if you tried to order from a store that is not open yet do you have to wait until they open as it will not let you select that store. I would simply like to select my sub and store for a schedule the time every day like I do on so many other apps.

Why is it that on the other food delivery apps CUSTOMERS choose whether they would like their sandwich toasted or not but on the actual SUBWAY app SUBWAY has made the decision to TOAST all sandwiches by default unless the customer specifically chooses not toasted? Why is TOASTED chosen for us and the app allows the customer to submit the order without choosing for themselves? I feel that the app needs an update that UNCHECKS TOASTED and allows the customer themselves to choose how they would like their sandwich prepared. 

Another company would have compensated me for my negative experience while Subway just says, ‚ÄúThank you for your feedback.‚Äù Yeah, I think that was my last Subway experience.",,Subway

Every launch of the app starts with an error. Not a comforting sign, but I have been using it and it works, so I think it is just something they over looked. 
My big issue is with the mapping. They show you pins on the map, but when it comes to finding a convenient location, you better be familiar with the address system in your town (or leave the app and Google, but I ahiuldnt have to do that). Every other food app shows the pins on a map. You click on them and that stores info comes up and ready to order. The map and the address list are in no way connected.

So I called the guy who made the sandwich and he forgot to add other toppings like olives and onions. So I basically had this weightless sandwich.  Basically he said he couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. I told him every time I use the app something messes up and I admitted it was my fault I forgot the cheese.

What is the purpose of ordering through the app when I have to wait 45 minutes for my order. That is not just this location. It has happened at other subway locations too. I order through the app for many restaurants but SUBWAY takes the win in the slowest service through the app. Cannot blame employees because there‚Äôs only one at a time. How can they take care of customers waiting + the ones who ordered on the app. I gave Subway three chances at three different locations via app. The app is the most useless creation and a waste of time for the developers who created it.

It allows you to build a sandwich and then errs out when placing in the bag after trying for a minute.  Very irritating.  Forces me to lose out on deals or choose somewhere else to eat. 

Old:  The app itself worked well.  After order I noticed there might be options for contact free delivery after order was placed, but maybe it was just ‚Äúcoming soon‚Äù.    I will look more closely next time before placing order.  

My ‚Äúin store‚Äù experience was not very good.  I walked in and saw a bag with my three pre-paid sandwiches behind the counter.  All the employees had to do was verify my name and hand me the bag.  Instead a I had to wait in line for three people to slowly go through the normal sandwich creation process.  

SUGGESTION:
Train employees to be aware that the new customer that walked in might be the one who has that completed order waiting.  Take 10 seconds to verify the name and hand them their pre-paid order rather than making them wait 5+ minutes while others complete their orders normally.

UPDATE:  It‚Äôs all good. I read the app instructions more closely.  Just walk to the register directly.  This signals the employees you have a prepaid order.

And how do you pick up your food? Well you can do curbside or in store.

If you do curbside during lunch hour, just know that you‚Äôll be waiting a while because Subway doesn‚Äôt have a lot of people on staff to actually carry out this implementation. You‚Äôll more than likely need to step out and go into the store. It‚Äôs not an inconvenience for me, but thankfully I‚Äôm not disabled or really in need of this.

The in store pickup is just as bad though. There is no formal way to do it. Customers standing in line won‚Äôt let you through because they feel like you‚Äôre cutting in line and the people behind the counter are busy taking care of customers in line. No formal line made to indicate where to pick up. No designated area set aside so customers can just come in and grab their food once it‚Äôs ready.

Awful and poor implementation. And this app has been out for a while and other restaurants that just started doing this are doing this a million times better.

I have tried to call the store six times with no answer it just keeps hanging up and telling me to go back because the sandwich maker is busy. This is why I do not suggest this app at least when you order in the store you know you‚Äôre going to get what you asked for. The app is useless when no one follows what you asked for.

 And then there is the inventory issue: it said a store didn‚Äôt have mustard and another one doesn‚Äôt have salt. I have easily subways 100 or more subways in 6 different countries in the past. I have never been to a store that doesn‚Äôt have salt. Makes no sense what so ever.

So then figured maybe have to order thru email.  So back email, app same and again no favorites to choose from.  Fooled around a minute and located my favorites at a store I had used previously, but not one I currently wanted to use.  Bummer.

Again started new order and previewed written summary of each sandwich.  Looked good.  
Went checkout and would not take credit card info.  Put in new credit card. Wanted scan new card, but that was not working.
Had keep going in and out of app and for some unknown reason it finally worked.  30 min later I had a confirmation.  Whew!  

Picked up food, got home and order was wrong.  Receipt showed items that I hadn‚Äôt chosen.  Again the written preview showed exactly what I had ordered before I checked out.  How did it get changed?   How does this happen?  I am now in the twilight zone.  What a mess, soooooooo frustrating!!!

Very surprised Subway doesn‚Äôt have automated integration testing to catch show stopping bugs like the ability to place an order. For any devs who might read this review, I‚Äôm unsure of the source of my corrupted state. It‚Äôs either that I applied the pop up coupon for the free foot long sub, or, when I first tried to buy my CC was expired, so I updated it, came back and was never able to order.

It‚Äôs also like a game (in a bad way) where you have to be careful what you touch because it will toss in a drink and chips into your order while all you want to do is change one ingredient. The only reason for using an app instead of ordering in person is because it is supposed to be faster and easier. The app in it‚Äôs current state does neither.

One of the beautiful things about subway is being able to walk in and customize a sandwich to your exact liking: protein, cheeses, add-ons, and sauces galore. That, unfortunately, is not the case here on the app. There are very few sandwiches to select from and what are available are set and fixed so if, for example, you choose a ham and cheese melt, it is impossible to add, say, turkey or bacon. There is also not a full list of sauces on the app. So you can add basic condiments like Mayo, mustard, oil and vinegar, but the fun ones such as creamy sriracha or southwest (etc) are not featured and available on the app. All in all, this is a big bust for my family.

The app obviously knows that my store is not honoring the special, so why doesn‚Äôt it just say so. I guess they are taking advantage of the people who don‚Äôt check the total before they submit their order and ripping them off.

Also annoying: constantly being asked to save favorite sandwiches, going through the trouble of naming them, and then being told the app can't save them because I've reached my limit. The app shouldn't ask me to save them if that's true.

The message is ‚ÄúSomething has gone wrong with your account, contact customer support‚Äù. I have looked all over the Subway website and have found no options in their contact us section regarding the app, and the FAQ section was of no help either. 

I am very disappointed by the decision to not include a phone number anywhere on the app or website to talk to a customer service representative.

Also, items like the raspberry cheesecake cookies are not an option to pick but they are always readily available at each Subway I order from. I have learned to use the special instructions field to request them instead of chocolate chip. However, the special instructions field only allows so many characters so you can‚Äôt write much in it.

The final insult is that they didn‚Äôt prepare it because they could see the order. This last time a different person went in for me and didn‚Äôt know all the details of the order but he had to tell them the order because the store didn‚Äôt have the info. Oh, it got my money no problems though. Because the pickup person didn‚Äôt know all the details he didn‚Äôt mention things I paid extra for.

Also, when creating the sub, and on the ‚Äúsauces‚Äù screen, you should add buttons to indicate whether I want that particular sauce on the side.

After messing with it and realizing it‚Äôs a day it‚Äôs just not going to work, I sometimes attempt to use the very frustrating online ordering, which glitches way more than the app, or I just give up.

It‚Äôs easier to land a 747 fully loaded in a 3rd world country than it is to place a $47 order on the Subway app. Apps are to be dumbed down to name, rank and serial number. The app exists to create easy, simple and convenient ordering for customers. That‚Äôs it. Minimum viable product type thinking. 

I‚Äôm a user-interface guy. I just ordered five sandwiches. It would have been easier to stand in a line and place my order in person. I found the app to be clunky, unintuitive and wonky to say the least. The app is absent of any type of natural flow. I honesty think it would be better to scuttle the current app and just have two buttons. Button one, where do you want to pick-up your order? Button two, press and we will connect you to that store via phone so you may place your order. As bad as that sounds, it‚Äôs better than what you have now. 

If you want some help, please shoot me an email. Subway needs to raise its game and not spend precious resources on a bad apps that I am sure cost way too much. 

Please improve. I really want you guys to succeed. And please don‚Äôt offer me a coupon or free anything for my feedback. Take that money and put it in your app re-do fund. I think you guys might need it more than me.

I search all over the subway website to find someone to contact but apparently this is the only free form source of frustration I can offer.

The graphical sandwich builder makes it hard to see that the bread type is not what I wanted.  The graphical builder also doesn't pick default veggie choices automatically that you would get at store (for instance pickles are normally the default all veggies, but not selected in the app).  Being able to disable the graphical builder and just checkbox the items would be better, it would be more clear which veggies are missing from the default.

Then after him telling everyone that they did not have our orders he magically had everyone‚Äôs receipts which had been sitting there the whole time.

For instance, if the store I‚Äôm ordering to closed early or doesn‚Äôt do the BOGO deal, looking for a store that does honor it takes you manually trying every single store and ‚Äúclearing your cart‚Äù each time you change locations.

I'm not exactly clueless, this new app version is USELESS.

I HATE this new App! It is so much harder to navigate. You can't cancel an order, you can only delete everything off an order one item at a time.  Ordering items by pictures is so slow and for idiots. I used to use the app a lot, now not at all. It was really great for when ordering with a group, just hand the phone to the next person. Now I have to tell them how to navigate.

Old review:
My review for previous version:
Love ordering through the app, I use it nearly every day.  There's 4 features I wish it had:
1- favorite locations, instead of waiting to find them every time.
2- favorite meals, I tend to order one of 4-5 different subs.
3- let me redeem my reward points, I have a ton 
4- let me add a note to my order, like ""please toast the veggies,"" or ""add Italian dressing,"" which is common in Michigan but seemingly no where else.

Love the app! Huge time saver!

Also I ran into the problem of needing to cancel my order because I had forgotten to put in the pick up time I needed. I needed it in 5 hours for a dinner party instead of the 15 minute pick up window it was set to.

The branch just made the food because of the order coming from THE MALFUNCTIONING APP. 

I love subway and I will visit again to buy food. However, I WILL NEVER USE THE APP. I have many apps operated by restaurants such as Panera and Chipotle, but I have never had the problem even if I use them tons of times. The Subway app is only one having this issue. 

I have read other people‚Äôs complaints about the app. They are very similar with the problem I had and the customer center replied that they could help you if you call them. 

The customer service will help you by just telling you that you need to talk to the branch. 

I strongly suggest that you google your favorite location and order through the phone. IF YOU REALLY WANT TO USE THE APP, PLEASE AT LEAST DON‚ÄôT SAVE YOUR CREDIT CARD INFORMATION.

I have used this new version successfully exactly once out of the several times I tried. 
My final straw for writing this negative review was this past weekend. I downloaded the newest version to my iPad while on a road trip and couldn't get the frickin app to choose the store I wanted, which was 50 miles away. I wanted to queue up the order as there were 7 of us in the car and it was going to take a while to create the order and then have it made.
After closing the app and going back in, it only took three tries to select the store I wanted. Then I tried adding a sandwich. It said there was an error when I tried adding it to my cart and I just gave up. We ended up eating at Wendy's, even though we couldn't order ahead there either.

At pickup my sandwich was ready at the correct time and the order was 100% correct so it obviously feeds into their store point of sale properly. Only misfires were that the app does not accept Apple Pay as a Payment method even though the stores do and there is a Notes section in the order where i asked for the foot long to be halved and wrapped individually and they did not. This is likely a store issues but perhaps the point of sale doesn‚Äôt indicate when there is a note on the order.,,Subway
283,Consistently poor user experience,False,FastPhil100,2022-08-17 11:06:36,1,"It‚Äôs nice to get some deals through the app, but the trade offs are bad.

1. You want your sandwich hot? That‚Äôs unlikely. The sandwich gets made whenever it gets made and you don‚Äôt know exactly when it comes out of the oven. There is a 15-minute window for when your sandwich will be ready, but it might be baked before that too. I believe that for app orders, they put the order in one bag (or the stores around me do). Which means if you order one hot and one cold sub, you get two lukewarm subs.

2. If you see a store offering a sub on the menu in the app, that doesn‚Äôt actually mean the store offers that product. I went for a long walk yesterday to the grab a breakfast sub. I chose to walk to that Subway because it was the only one near me with breakfast subs on the menu in the app (and listed on Google maps). Corporate store as well. I arrived around 8:30am and was told they stopped carrying breakfast a few months earlier. It was a hungry walk home.

If we had known that‚Äôs how they were going to deliver, we would have just ordered through DoorDash‚Äôs app. At least there, if there is a problem it can get fixed without having to dispute the charge with my bank.

304,Repeated failures without clear information as to why,False,Phil___________,2020-08-16 21:24:02,1,"The first time I tried to use the app, I was unable to complete the order. I‚Äôll be ordering at Jimmy John‚Äôs instead.

First, when attempting to select a restaurant where I could order, the app showed me several restaurants listed as ‚Äúopen‚Äù and several listed as ‚Äúclosed.‚Äù When I selected the first ‚Äúopen‚Äù one, I was shown a message stating that it wasn‚Äôt *actually* open and to choose a different restaurant. Then I was redirected to a page where I had to again search for locations (instead of just taking me back to the list that was already displayed).

This happened with the second restaurant I selected as well (‚Äúopen‚Äù but actually closed).

The third restaurant I selected allowed me to start to build an order. However, of the five different subs I tried to build, none of them allowed me to choose foot-long or wrap options; only six-inch was available.

My intention was to order two foot-long subs to take advantage of the ‚Äú$5 foot-long‚Äù deal. In fact, ordering two six-inch subs would have cost more than the promotional price for double the amount of food.

I canceled the order and plan to uninstall the app.",,Subway
305,Accessibility with VoiceOver needs some improvement with customizing ingredients,False,doggrowl,2020-02-22 10:24:53,2,"VoiceOver works well in this app, except when you try to customize an item.
The biggest problem is the method used to select and customize the ingredients one wants in their sandwich.
Each item in the list is spoken as ‚Äúdouble tap to customize item‚Äù. If I have ten ingredients shown, and each one says that, how am I supposed to know which ingredient I am customizing? It‚Äôs super confusing and needs some attention from the developers.

Please make it so individual ingredients are labeled. FOr example: ‚ÄúTap to customize tomato‚Äôs‚Äù, ‚Äúcustomize ham‚Äù, ‚Äúcustomize mayo‚Äù, Etc.
As it stands, I need someone to help me customize each new order. I‚Äôve added some to my favorites for future ease-of-use, but if I want something different, I‚Äôm stuck.

Also, the bread type selector is terrible to use with VoiceOver! Again, I need help from someone sighted to perform what should be a simple task.

I‚Äôve placed orders with other restaurants, because this app was difficult to use. So, you‚Äôve lost some sales here.

I could select the second, but the moment I went to customize the meat option shown under the sandwich titled turkey breast said philly steak. The first time or two I thought maybe user error and I was somehow modifying the first sandwich in my cart. By tries 3 and beyond I realized the problem was the app and not the user. I had to submit two separate orders to get what I wanted. I will be immediately deleting this app the moment I pick my sandwiches up.

The owner of our local shop tells us that unless the preparers see the price and notices that it‚Äôs not the standard price, there‚Äôs no way else for them to know you asked for double meat. This is a glitch in the app that subway is in no hurry to fix. It seems like planned fraud since they know about it but they don‚Äôt fix it.

Instead of letting me know they were out, the app automatically changed all bread orders to 9-grain wheat and changed all sandwiches to ‚ÄúNo Cheese.‚Äù  My family was not happy and I could not complain to the local store because when I expanded my individual sandwich orders, they all showed with no cheese and 9-grain wheat so the local shop made them correctly.

It requires more wrangling than an unhinged, raging bull. I feel like I can think up 6-7 updates to this app in 10 minutes that would work wonders, but here are three:
1) just have a one page, check mark sheet for sandwich, toppings, chips/drink, etc.

Subway is all about making each sandwich the way the customer wants but in that respect the app falls short.  I wanted a one meat and one cheese sandwich and there wasn‚Äôt a way I could find to do so.  I even tried to order a sandwich with multiple meats and just delete the unwanted meat. Nope the app would let me delete toppings but not meat. 
  I also want my sauce on the side. I couldn‚Äôt find a way to leave a comment or special requests for a sandwich.

The app forced me to logout to agree to the new terms and conditions, now I can‚Äôt log in because it‚Äôs automatically taking me to ‚Äúforget my password‚Äù page, which I did & still can‚Äôt login

Wallet and Touch ID integration still not available. I visited one of your stores and I couldn‚Äôt use my card to pay for my order because the lady couldn‚Äôt figure out how to scan my subway card.

Downloaded the app and I wanted to buy subway card for myself and it was a terrible experience. If I created account with my personal information then I shouldn't have to enter everything all over again to buy my self a subway reward card.

Another example is to have a bread choice as 2nd or 3rd option. I ordered and when getting order picked up they were out, so an employee chose what bread, which happened to be my least likely to get. There should be a backup option so if this happens the employees have a direction to go.

When I got my order I noticed there was way too many subs. Looked at my order on the app and my sandwich was added 3 more times to the order!!! This could not be an accidental mistake because you have to physically press the button to add one more of the same sandwich and it takes a few seconds to load. Started a new order on the app and I watched the same thing happen as I started to add more sandwiches! Scam?!,,Subway

It might be a small thing to complain about but I actually like the broccoli and cheddar as well as the chicken noodle soups you sell on the side or as an option to add to the subway sub combo. Not all subways might have the option all the time but I think it would still be nice if you added the soups as an option to order everything on the app instead of buying part of your order on the app and then ordering the soup when you get there.

Despite removing them, the sandwich retained the flavors.

I do not have the time nor the gas money/funds to waste in ordering the sandwich I want and returning to the store. 

In addition, I cannot find how to remove items from my favorites list, and the only way I have seen to add an item to my favorites is immediately after ordering the item.

634,Poor app design causes user frustration.,False,DLP1000,2022-01-09 02:19:23,2,"Here are two reasons I dislike this app. 

1) I used a gift card and now have 2 dollars remaining. The only option is to pay the entire amount by Apple Pay or add money to the gift card. There is no option to pay first by gift card and then by Apple Pay. The result is an unused gift card balance which profits Subway while ripping off the consumer.

2) I accidentally selected carside pickup. I tried to change it but there is no option to toggle in-store pickup after the feature is selected. When I arrived, the one carside space was filled up so I parked and walked inside. I waited in line then asked for my order. The person said it was for carside pickup and told me to go back to my car and call the store. I showed the receipt and eventually they gave me the order.

My husband picks up the order and his no produce sandwich had the stock produce, I thought it was an error on the restaurant nope the app shows produce even tho I selected none.

So I tried guest checkout. The menu didn't show veggie options that I know my restaurant has, so I just entered them manually in the notes section. 

Then when I got to the payment, it somehow doesn‚Äôt use any of the phones built-in autocomplete. So I had to enter everything manually. Since I can‚Äôt make an account, this means I will probably have to repeat all of these steps anytime I place an order, at which point, it would be quicker to just stand in line at the store.

I was using the app in California and when I came back to Florida, it stuck with the California location even thought it said it was 900 miles away... then told me my order would be ready in 20 minutes.

I was unable to cancel the order in the app and the local franchise wouldn‚Äôt answer their phone. So I was stuck paying for it and the app help support wasn‚Äôt too concerned with my issue.

It was my fault, I get it, but it should not let me order from across the country.","{'id': 5477146, 'body': ""Your feedback is really important to us and we're always looking for ways to improve your experience!

717,The only way that I will order Subway,False,Hedge Master,2018-10-01 16:54:50,4,This app is brilliant!  I no longer have to stand beside sick people in the line during flu season nor do I have to wait behind slow/obnoxious people in general.  It‚Äôd be cool if I could wave my smartphone or Apple Watch in front of a window to dispense my freshly-prepared food.  Points pay-out needs to be improved!  The points need to meet or exceed the old paper Subway cards to keep me coming back for more!  $2 rewards just doesn‚Äôt cut it.  Swap that for a free foot-long sub!,,Subway

It always picks the location from previous order instead of the one nearer to user's current location. At least there should have been a prompt to confirm the location. Many a times, I placed the order for wrong location (assuming that it picks based on current location which many other food ordering apps do) and there no way I can cancel it.",,Subway

There are also some design issues. When you want to re-order something previous, the app forces you to go to the same location that you previously ordered from.   It won‚Äôt let you re-order the same meal from a different location; you have to select the new location and start all over again. Very irritating.

The second issue is how slow and bug-ridden it is. In just my last order I had 3 errors all before the 4th error telling me my order couldn‚Äôt be completed (I know fool me once shame on you, fool me FOUR TIMES, shame on me).

The app lags so badly, regardless if it‚Äôs on wifi or the 4G cellular network.

The UI is anything but user-friendly.  One suggestion: get rid of the option to add chips/cookie and a drink under EVERY SINGLE LINE ITEM.  That is cluttered and makes the order appear confusing.  There‚Äôs already a pop-up to make it a meal.  If I didn‚Äôt select it when I was adding things to the cart, why would I want them now?

Also on the subject of the UI: it takes FOREVER to place an order because of how the pages are set up.  When you order a sandwich, the app redirects you to the Home Screen to order the next one.

We now have no way of knowing what their earlier sandwich had in it, and have to check if their treatment has to be delayed by as much as a week because Subway couldn‚Äôt be bothered to say in the app that egg whites aren‚Äôt available.

Subway uses a point/reward system but doesn‚Äôt promote it. A lot of companies will entice you points/rewards to make a sale. This app is such a potential loss.

Will keep the app just so I know how much points I have (to see if/when I can redeem them), but that‚Äôs about it.
If I need to make room on my phone in the future, this app will be one of the first to go.

Subway made a big mistake developing this to the newest version of their online ordering app.

The prior version was far more functional. The new app is a downgrade. Ordering is a mess. Finding a new store almost impossible. If you are fortunate enough to be able to find a store and put in an order, the app will create the wrong date for pick up.

THE UI
The main issue I have is the UI. Your UI is so cluttered and hard to understand. There are so many random buttons and pieces of text all over the place making the app super difficult to use. You should also make it easier to favorite sandwiches and meals. I will say that I really like the UI when customizing a sandwich. Do more things like this.

DELIVERY
On your website, it says you deliver, but there is no delivery option. I am assuming  that you only deliver with door dash and Uber, but you need to be a lot more specific. It is very confusing.

And if you‚Äôre in an order and want to update the size of the sandwich you have to start that part over! Also an issue with updating items in the cart that ended up adding the item over again - the pencil should be only for editing, NOT adding additional sandwiches.

And the interface is not intuitive. Why pre populate with toppings I don‚Äôt want? Add to that the fact you cannot customize the veggies on each half of a foot long and you end up with a pretty poor excuse for an app for a sandwich chain based on the idea of customizing it to your liking.",,Subway

Also I do not think I was refunded the surcharge... and the staff did not speak good enough written English to understand me (I am deaf after all)...

The one time I did remember to scan my phone beforehand I didn‚Äôt get my points, the cashier finished the transaction and said it‚Äôs too late I can‚Äôt get my points. 
Saving your past orders is helpful but the rest is pointless.","{'id': 4255795, 'body': ""Hi there- you can earn tokens on purchases using your phone number (associated with your account), a plastic Subway¬Æ Rewards/Gift card or the mobile app. If you didn't scan before the transaction was complete, you can also request your tokens by logging into your Subway¬Æ MyWay Rewards account on our website and filling out the Missing Tokens Request form.

1983,Good app but needs fine tuning,False,Sealfan1,2018-02-20 22:17:18,5,"Pros:
I can create my meal and customize my sandwich item by item and pick the location abd time for pickup. I can also reorder from my previous purchases. 

Cons:
I cannot reorder and change the pickup location. I have to start the order from scratch. 
I should be able to reorder a previous item, and just change the location for pickup. 

Also not sure if you can include any promo codes fir coupons texted to me. I haven‚Äôt tried but I don‚Äôt recall seeing a field for this. Would be nice if promos camevto me via the app vs text.",,Subway
1984,Can‚Äôt even order a foot long,False,The1ilove,2018-05-13 13:02:07,1,Tried to order a foot long and the only option they showed on the app was 6 inches. I called customer support and the person tried to have me recite my order to them over the phone instead of telling me a way to order a foot long from the app. She asked if I tried ordering online from a computer which I hadn‚Äôt. So I gave it a shot and the only two options given to me were 6 inches and chopped salad. Why can‚Äôt I order the thing that Subway is best known for?,"{'id': 3478230, 'body': 'We apologize for any inconvenience this caused. The location may need to adjust their menu.

1985,Great App,False,Shayjae,2021-12-01 17:29:48,5,I love having my order delivered.  My sandwich comes quicker than if I had to drive to the store and pick it up and drive back in traffic.  The sandwiches are always made correctly. The app is easy to use.,,Subway
1986,Bad app!,False,Sleepy Eye Schmidy,2018-01-17 18:28:11,1,"When this app worked (which was 50/50) it was nice I could go in and pick up my sandwich really easy. Now my app does not work, and hasn‚Äôt worked for about a month or longer.  Guess how many sandwiches I have purchased from the store during that time‚Ä¶ Zero!

Unfortunately, every time I go to use it I have to delete it and re-install it. If I don't I get an error that my cart is expired and it won't let me place an order. 
I wish it had a ""build your own sandwich"" option. I have a child that substitutes one meat for another one and it's not an option on the app. I wind up having to call her order in separately.","{'id': 1144863, 'body': 'Hi there.

Maybe have a notification that says they are closed but an order can be made for a future time, like another restaurant app I have.

1989,Multiple problems,False,halfItalianmom,2022-11-13 02:22:24,1,"It lags often & doesn‚Äôt allow for multiple methods of payment. And you can only use one method of payment per transaction. For example, if you have multiple gift cards, or a combination of gift card(s) and another method of payment, it doesn‚Äôt allow you to combine. They force you to order online for many coupons, but then you can‚Äôt pay the way you want.",,Subway
1990,It says download app and earn rewards but totally lie!,False,Cokfazlareklam,2022-10-04 02:12:51,1,There is no rewards and any points when you download it. It is disappointed. It is not worth to download it for get points or deals. There is a special offer and deals on app but it says the point of subway coupons no subway restaurant participate in your areas which I live in downtown Seattle! I tried other locations but didn‚Äôt work. Totally waste your time to get food from here.,,Subway

1992,Works half the time,False,PeanutinGJ,2022-08-07 20:32:42,1,"Thought this would save time but takes longer to add sandwiches and pay compared to just ordering at the store.

1993,waste of time,False,eva meg,2022-07-23 23:46:03,1,Seriously this app is so terrible! It rarely works. The annoying thing is you don‚Äôt know that the app doesn‚Äôt work until you are done with the options and going to pay. I had a long order and was adding things to my cart. When I went to review and pay the stupid cart wouldn‚Äôt load. It kept saying refresh cart or return to menu. I swear this app is junk and a serious waste of time.,,Subway

1997,Horrible,False,rtdoug,2022-02-23 17:31:49,1,I ordered a sub online and the subway said they can‚Äôt make it and I have to cancel it in the app. Problem is you can‚Äôt cancel in the app and the there isn‚Äôt a phone number or anything. I will never order subway on the app ever again and customer service is unreachable I may never eat at subway again since they don‚Äôt care about customer service.
