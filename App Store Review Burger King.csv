0,5,Will only order delivery with the app!,"We are avid DoorDash customers and order from them sometimes a few times a week, but we HATE it when we want to modify menu items and the DoorDash app won’t allow us to make the same changes as we could ordering at the drive thru! That’s why I am SO HAPPY I found the Burger King app for us! (I wasn’t used to using apps specific to each restaurant until now) DoorDash doesn’t allow simple changes like extra cheese, and for Burger King you can’t even add special requests.  So luckily the Burger King app allows you to delete ingredients, add extra or make it light. EVERY INGREDIENT on EVERY SANDWICH, not just the common extra cheese or no pickle! Thank you, Burger King, for remembering “order it your way” should be possible no matter how we are getting our order!!!

BTW, I’ve tried to post this for what must be TWENTY TIMES or more by now BUT every time I try it tells me my nickname has already been taken! Pretty ridiculous when I enter something like “frustrated no nicknames are left” and a message pops up that it’s taken! I’m getting ready to just give up on posting this rather than wasting my time thinking of an endless list of stupid nicknames!",2021-03-20 19:31:26,False,Ugh!l!,,Burger King
1,4,What’s up?,"What’s up Burger King? I’m 70 and been eating your meals for many years, from California to Arizona, never have I ever had an issue with any of your restaurants and or the way you operate your business, such as specials that comes from the corporate office, manager specials, coupons, specials that are on television, until now, the end of January 2022 and February 1st. I saw on television and was impressed with the special $5.00 meal, well I’m sad to report to you that not all of your restaurants are honoring the price, I’ve been told from two restaurants that the meal is in there system for $6.00 and they can’t and won’t change the price and honor your advertisement, now one dollar plus the tax isn’t a lot of money, but some of us are on a fixed income and every dollar is more valuable than a few years ago, but that’s really not the point, you at corporate take the time and money to run this special for your customers and a number of your restaurants don’t honor the price you set, now, that makes me question your operation of business, how can I trust your organization if your employees are not willing to observe what comes out of corporate? As a long standing customer, I hope you get this under control, thank you for letting me express my thoughts. ☹️",2022-02-01 21:44:43,False,Al 2525,,Burger King
2,1,WORST FOOD APP EVER,"I know this won’t be seen through all the fake five star reviews but this is the WORST food app I have ever used… even worse than Chick Fila. It doesn’t tell you until after you pay for your order that the coupon/deal you used wasn’t for the location you went to, DON’T SHOW THE COUPON IF IT’S NOT AVAILABLE AT THAT LOCATION, I lost $22 on that order. When I complained they gave me a $10 off coupon I could only use through the app. I used it last night with a gift card and it didn’t take $10 off instead it charged me $1 to use the support coupon… ARE YOU SERIOUS?!? I have screenshots of my receipt showing this. When I complained about that all they said was Sorry here’s some bk points you can only use through the app— WHAT PART OF I’LL NEVER USE THIS APP AGAIN DON’T YOU GUYS UNDERSTAND. And the workers say that they have no control over the app and they can’t fix anything for you when the app messes up and that they’re constantly being yelled at by customers because there’s always an issue when someone uses the app to order. The people who chose this app and its programmers should look into whoever did McDonald’s app because theirs is flawless and if something messes up the restaurant is able to fix it themselves. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE MONEY!!!!!!!

3,5,Technical Issues with App,"EDIT: I was contacted a day after writing my review. Despite my frustration at the time, I am glad that the BK Team took time to reach out and resolve the issue. Despite the fixes the app may need, their act of taking accountability was superb.

To the BK Tech Team, if you’re reading this please contact me.
I’ve used the BK App for more than a year now and my experiences have varied. There’s been times that I’ve made an order through the app with absolutely no problems. However, there’s been many more times that the app has given me some sort of issue. Based on the reviews, it’s clear that the app needs PLENTY of work.
Now you may be wondering why I decided to post a review until now. That’s because I now have several screen recordings of the app providing issues. Today, specifically, I was using a coupon that required the purchase of another item. The coupon and additional item were visible in My Cart/Checkout (and in the screen recording). However, after paying, the order completely erased the coupon. Given I was on my lunch break for work, it made a lovely afternoon, very inconvenient.",2020-06-22 06:29:36,True,EFRCZBNKFd,"{'id': 16032427, 'body': 'We’re bummed to hear that you didn’t have the most ideal experience.

4,1,Frustrating and useless,"I’ve been using the app on and off for about a year or two for the only reason that it either works perfectly or it just doesn’t work and takes up storage space on your phone and wastes your time opening and trying to refresh. Recently the app has been useless and disappointing because where I live I don’t get the paper or mailed in coupons so I rely on the app to get some good deals but what’s the point when it doesn’t work, not even to peak at the coupons I have picked eating at other restaurants then going to BK only because the app doesn’t work especially right now at these times of the virus you can’t have even order online you get through all the trouble of adding everything all the coupons and food only for it to tell you “your order cannot be completed try again” and then the app takes all of the food off your cart and forces you to redo everything only for it to do the same thing and not make any progress towards an order. There have been days where I’ve thought I’d rather go to Arby’s then Burger King and that’s crazy because the only good thing there is the curly fries but if their app works better it’s worth filling up on then going through all that pain. Please developers work on your app fix all these issues the app has I’m sure I’m not the only one with these problems.",2020-12-14 22:06:32,False,Papaericano,"{'id': 19792049, 'body': 'We’re bummed to hear that you didn’t have the most ideal experience.

5,1,They completely screwed up the UX in this “update”,"Dear reader : please excuse my hangry tone. There are many more things bothering me (same as the rest of us)than this app. BK app just becomes my lightening rod today.

They completely screwed up the UX. It is now hard to customize a whopper. It used to have a simple highlight the topping option. Now it’s a confusing more, regular, light option with pluses and minuses around it. Also I can’t see where my cart is. What have I ordered? I click “order” and I’m dumped back to the beginning “where are you eating today”. Whoever did this UX should be fired. Here are some tips for these amateurs : 1. Have sensible defaults, especially based on what I’ve ordered before 2. Make it clear what my current order state is 3. Make it simple to continue my ordering from my order state screen. You guys don’t understand that UX in a app like this is to guide me to what I want and not throw me curveballs leaving me baffled and frustrate. Don’t you get it that 80 percent of your orders will come from only semi motivated buyers who won’t make an effort to do more? Rigging hoops for us to jump through will lose you business. I literally walked away from a BK because I couldn’t place an order on the phone and get a deal. Why not just order old school? Because I feel disrespected that you destroyed such a great experience. You must not care if you have my business or not. I got pizza instead.",2019-12-13 18:01:34,False,Dont-make-me-think,,Burger King
6,3,The app is good when it works,"Overall the app is good it’s when it work but doesn’t work that’s the problem the majority of the problem is it’s very glitchy it’s very laggy and for something that should be fixed because it’s 2020 literally all those issues could be easily fixed. I get discounts all the time popping up my notifications however when I click on the notifications it will not let me login it will not let me even look at the menu it just gives me a white screen for hours and hours. this is not a good way to have an app out if you have an out make sure it’s fixed. And another thing if you order from the delivery on the app it does not work because not all their restaurants are not connected to the delivery system. Making me lose a few bucks which is totally unacceptable.

Even if I change my passwords right a few minutes before and then put in the right password it won’t let me login. And if it does show up the login page which it doesn’t anymore. It will take about 30 minutes to see anything it’s not an easy app if you wanted to coupon honestly go online and try to find one or wait until it comes in the mail because that’s a lot quicker.",2020-11-04 23:14:50,False,2000Nat22,"{'id': 18931826, 'body': 'We’re bummed to hear that you didn’t have the most ideal experience.

7,3,Just needs some bugs fixed,"Overall I like the app. Here are the issues as I see them. When customizing your order, there is no option to remove a normally included condiment. The outings are light, regular and extra. So the diligent employees ask if you meant light or if you wanted the option left off your order. Also, the drink options in combo meals are not complete. The soft drinks are listed but there is not an option to order an iced tea which I believe is the same price. The app says it's checking with the local/chosen store before finalizing the order but it doesn't. Twice I've placed an order that should not have been accepted. One time the store was closed early for cleaning. The other time I ordered a milk shake but their machine was broken. Most recently, the app has been glitchy. Just today I was going to place an order. It took several tried to get to the order or deal screen (the home screen appeared to be nonresponsive). Once I could get to the offer/order screen, it key me choose my order then went to a blank screen and froze (tried more than once). This has been happening more often recently and as I usually place an order just before leaving the house for work, if the app doesn't work I choose another restaurant.",2020-11-01 20:37:29,False,Jorr98,,Burger King
8,5,Bad service to good service,"To be honest I love this app. But I had a bad experience today at a Burger King when they didn’t give me a 2nd package of sauce after I ordered 4 items. They tried to charge me 27¢ and didn’t even give me ketchup. I would’ve complained to company Headquaters but they’re the ones who probably told them they can’t give sauce because of inflation. The manager literally told me “you can’t put sauce on fries”. I personally know she was having a terrible day and trying to abuse her authority on me. That’s exactly what it was, but instead of arguing at all I just took my food and left very calmly. I’m thankful I didn’t turn over a trash there; instead Burger King just lost a customer until they give me a few free meals. I understand trying to save money, but to act the way she did and I’m not even detailing 25% of how bad she was.., that’s unacceptable to me.

Update: Burger King Headquaters helped me out and forwarded my complaint. Hopefully this doesn’t happen to anyone else.

9,3,"Great offers, and a vastly improved app","OLD REVIEW:  So I assume this review will get lost in the sea of other reviews, but here are the specific problems I have noticed.  I ordered a deal which included two sandwiches.  If you customize either sandwich, you can’t customize the other.  But ok whatever.  I wanted to order a strawberry shake, but oops, it’s not on the menu.  The other flavors are, just not strawberry.  Weird.  And I didn’t try it, but it seemed like it was going to allow me to order a root beer, even though I know my local BK doesn’t have it.  I worry about what the employees would decide to substitute.  So, I didn’t really end up with what I wanted, but it was a good deal I guess.  Even though I know my review isn’t going to make it to the CEO’s desk, I expect a lot of these little annoyances will get ironed out in the future, and new ones will appear.  That’s how it is with app development these days.

NEW REVIEW:  Yay, they actually fixed most of the little issues I mentioned.  Did they read *my* review?  Haha, I doubt it.  Otherwise I’d be able to order a strawberry shake!  It’s a minor annoyance though - they still get 5 stars for great improvement in the latest version.

10,1,Useless,"This app is useless.  In order to see the menu, you have to select a restaurant. When you try to select a restaurant, it won't allow you to select a restaurant near you.  I've tried at least ten times to select the Burger King that is 2 blocks from my home.  The closest Burger King that it will allow me to select is 8 miles away, and is in a part of the city that I never visit.  I don't have a car and travel by bus or foot, so prefer to eat in the restaurant... however, that doesn't seem to be something that the BK corporate idiots seem to care about any more.  All they seem to care about is directing people to drive to certain restaurants for drive thru service only.  As a result I am unable to even look at the menu to see what is available at any Burger King restaurant.  Whoever thought that this was good customer service really needs to have his head examined, right before he is fired.

One additional thing... whoever thought of the idea of sending a link to e-mail to log into app, really has no clue.  The whole idea of using the app is to make things easy.  Now, instead of just opening app on phone... you have to enter number, open web page, open e-mail account, enter e-mail password, open BK e-mail, click on link, and finally get to app.  This defeats the whole purpose of having an app.  BK just lost another customer...",2020-03-09 16:22:50,False,Innomymous,,Burger King

He started having issues last year with not being able to get the 4 digit coupon codes anymore, only the 6 digit codes which none of the Burger Kings near us take. He has called BK several times for help with no action taken. I started having issues with my app last week. It just switch from 4 digit codes to 6 digit codes while I was standing in line getting ready to order. They don’t take them at this location or any others that we frequent. We eat at BK at least twice a week sometimes more. I called corporate yesterday and they told me they sent the issue to the tech dept and that I should be receiving a response in my email within 1 -2 hours. Guess what haven’t heard a thing. Very disappointed. We used the coupons on the app all the time. Since they changed the app to mobile ordering it hasn’t worked right. Very disappointed with BK and the non resolution of the issue. Not even a phone call or email to say they don’t accept 4 digit codes anymore. However the person I spoke with at corporate yesterday told me that most places haven’t changed to 6 digits codes yet and the 4 digits are what most stores accept.

12,4,Constant Change is Annoying but it is Improving,"I have been using the app since the first Covid lockdown last year.  Every time I use it the version and features are different.  That’s annoying but alit seems relatively complete and coherent now, so hopefully the future changes will be less disruptive.

Last year there were a lot of great deals available through the app.  Now it basically just accesses each store’s menu and pricing. I am sure that’s appreciated by the franchise holders more than by the end user (lol) but it’s better than having the stores pull out or refuse to honor the deal on the app.  (At one point the process would just get stuck when what you wanted wasn’t available.  Now that they check with the store every time before you order that doesn’t happen.

So in the end I think this app will be adequate and work as expected for most users.  It’s not going to help with prices but using in store pickup saves a huge amount of time vs using the drive through!   It’s also much easier to do counter pickup than the drive through when I am on a motorcycle, which I often am!",2021-05-12 15:42:30,False,so I J f try on t,,Burger King
13,1,This app is so hit or miss,"The idea of this app is great. Everything all in one spot to place my order. Sometimes, it works just as expected. But more often, it is so buggy. I’ve had the location not confirm, no matter how many times I try, and have ended up selecting a different restaurant to make the order work. I’ve had offers not load so I can’t claim them and end up buying food somewhere else. And now, I CANNOT get the order payment to happen. I’m getting the error that my payment won’t go through and to check with the cardholder. So I input a totally different card, same thing. Then I waited two days. Same problem. My husband has the same original card on his account and his order went through just fine on the first try. The user experience with this app is lacking.

I originally started using this app because of the T-Mobile Tuesday promotions. I hadn’t been to Burger King in years before that, but have used it more since downloading the app. But really, the app is making the experience not worth it.

I told the young lady at the counter I believe her name is Solmary and she took it back to the manager so that she could fix it! Well the “MANAGER “ seemed to be aggravated that I wanted my sandwich fixed how I wanted it (I mean I am paying my money) well since they seemed not to care about customer service I asked for my money back because why would I spend my money in an establishment where they CLEARY don’t care about their customers! Several of the employees working in the back began mouthing off saying that I need to “GONE ON” with that and I said I sure will and I would be writing a review! Well when I said that the cashier up from named Solmary said “WE DON’T CARE”. This was absolutely HORRIBLE and if the employee don’t care about the customers then they should not be working with customers because consumers are the ones that pay their paychecks!

Apparently restaurants are allowed to skip on preparing whatever food they don’t feel like making that day. I had to make a 10 mile trip to two different restaurants, starting the order all over again, fearing that I was going to end up being charged twice, which I’m still not sure about. If they were planning on getting more customers with this app, I think they all need to go back to the business school to learn a new way of doing things.

16,1,Loved until I couldn’t.,"I live in Astoria, NY which only has one location near my home (3310 Astoria Blvd).  The App came in very handy and I went to BK more often being able to preorder deals and pay on my way home from work.  This week they decided to remove themselves from the App from this location.  What’s to like now?
UPDATE:  The location finally agreed to add themselves back to the ‘nearest location’ list, and I enjoyed going back using the money-saving specials.  However, the last few months it will not process payments to prepay.  I get a message, ‘error retrieving item pricing,’ with instructions to retry.  Retrying never works.  When to settings and contacted support.  I was eventually emailed that I should clear cache and reinstall.  It’s all hogwash.  Didn’t work.  Contacted again and they said they would escalate.  That was months ago.  Still useless.
The reflection this gives of the Company is really disappointing.  BK, please be aware that I spoke to management at my location and they said all their App customers are experiencing this.  All those App customers are lost income to your business.  If I wanted to deal with lines, I wouldn’t use App.  My solution is to simply go to the McDonald’s App which has no technical problems and is down the road nearby.

Also, I had ordered two coffees with one being regular and the other being decaf (significant other CANNOT have regular caffeinated coffe), I was further shocked I there was no option to add any creamer/sugar/splenda, just straight up black coffee (McD’s and Wendy’s offers this in their respective apps). 

Received my order and to which the two coffees I ordered were not marked on the cups in any way, shape, or form. I know this is error on the employee preparing the order and not the app solely, but there should be a comment section at the very least to further state special instructions for food allergens or the like. So taking caution I tested each coffee to figure out the decaf and thought it was identified.

Nope!....Significant other ended drinking some of the regular caffeinated coffee and that didn’t go over so smooth with the heart rate but she is fine now thankfully.

You click the pencil, you click the word that says “Regular”, you click the word Onions or even the picture and it’s no good - the app freezes for a few minutes and you can eventually scroll through it again but it’s impossible to edit to remove onions or add extra pickles, etc.  

For someone who may read this - picking off the onions still leaves the taste of onion on the burger.  I’d rather it not be made with them, thanks - if I had an allergy “picking them off” wouldn’t stop me from having an attack from them.  Thankfully I’m not allergic I just can’t the taste or smell it brings to the burger.",2022-06-26 23:29:50,False,TVthePunisher,,Burger King
22,2,Store Vs. App,"So up until recently I have had minor issues. Mainly the app not showing what my actually store has and doesn’t have, the lack of options for a large icee(I know, trivial), other smaller items that I can deal with. 
But my last order has made me pretty upset. I ordered a whooper double and an icee, when I hit yo the store both the icee machine and broiler for the burger meat where down. I told the woman at the register that I just wanted a refund, she told me that the store has no control over that and I needed to contact app support. I have since contacted them and they are not telling me that the store needs to give me the refund but if they don’t to contact my bank. Sounds like someone doesn’t know what they’re doing. 
I shouldn’t have to contact ANY third party to get my money back. And now that I have this feeling I will not be using the app anymore since I have to call the store to insure that MY MONEY won’t be held up due to bad customer service. 
I want to be clear, I am blaming the app. Though the store has broken items, the workers can’t control that. Anyone working in customer service for the app should know how to help me rather than shove me off to someone else.",2019-08-06 17:10:21,False,CoriAmazon,,Burger King

The app chronically has an issue successfully submitting orders because if there’s some kind of unexplainable issue it will not tell me ANYTHING until I submit the order for payment then it will inform me that the “restaurant is unavailable”. Interestingly the store isn’t ever actually unavailable the app is simply bugging out and won’t accept my specific order until I resubmit without removing my allergens from the order. Secondly, I have ordered food within the breakfast time frame only to be informed after the order has been reassigned multiple times that they won’t make it, and the only way of contacting support to request cancellation or a refund is by email meanwhile the order is being reassigned again and again. This is not 4.7 avg rating experience I don’t know what everyone else is doing but this app is one of the crappiest pieces of tech I have EVER used in recent memory.

You know, the ones I rather begrudgingly glare at in the rear view mirror as they drive off while I’m still sitting in the parking lot. I hope you enjoy your whopper, good sir. I’ll get to mine next year! I digress. So as you can imagine, I was ecstatic hearing the good news of such an app! Order beforehand and roll off victoriously in under five minutes? Sign me the heck up, my body is ready!! I regret to inform the inquiring masses that my happiness was short lived and dreams were most definitely shattered. I was still pulled. My wait was longer than usual. And my experience was not magical. I did NOT have it my way, people. Not even with the app. No sorcery here and I am most displeased.

25,1,What’s the point if you can’t order anything?,"I’ve tried too many times to get this app to work and it just won’t. First off, the whole sign-in process just seems ridiculous. There’s no password setup being prompted, just enter your email address, go to your email, open the link in the sent email and it takes you to the app where you’re suddenly an account holder that’s signed-in. I really don’t feel like giving my payment information to something so seemingly not secure. 
Next, I want to order and this just simply can’t be done. You tap an offer from the offer list you want and it has you select pickup method, your store, and then, just a blank screen that never loads your order no matter how many tries I give it. (Okay, I think to myself. I’ll just try ordering without the offer.) If you try just making a non-offer related order, you go through the same hoops, just to end up at another blank screen. 
This app appears to not want to be an app, because it randomly seems to be loading the mobile version of Burger King’s website within the app and I think that’s where the problem arises? I’m not even sure.

26,2,Refunds Need Work,"I ordered through the app from pick up. We ordered two original chickens which is about all my wife eats from there. Pull up in the drive through and they are out. Of course they can’t refund there, so I have to go through the app. I put in my request and all I get is a lousy 15 dollar coupon. We barely eat there as is, so now I’m forced to still use the money there. I was told because my purchase was under 15 all they can do is a coupon. That seems shady. If all someone has is a few bucks and they pay for it then they are basically stuck either asking for something else or have to deal with it. That isn’t right and there needs to be a change. Until then I’ll use the coupon and never use the app or eat there again.

Edit: what the response from BK below shows is they don’t really read these reviews. When going through the app for a refund you have to contact support. If your amount is under $15 they won’t give you your money back. That is exactly my issue. Support is useless.

I dread every time the kids vote for Burger King. I’ve gotten pretty good at using the various fast food restaurants apps, and Burger King by far as been the most glitchy out of anything I’ve used.

The worst part of using the app is after I get everyone’s order in, I click on checkout and get the “Your order couldn’t be completed” error message. Why is this so bad? For those who haven’t used the app, when you get this error it forces you to empty your cart and start over. As someone who works on this technology behind the scenes, this is the worst sort of error message that you give a consumer. You want me to enter the entire family’s order (6 orders) in again? I try one more time, usually get the error again, and then veto the family and go to the arches instead.

I’ve tried to be patient, as it does seem the BK technology team is making improvements, but after running into this error today, I give up.

I was charged and without a meal. I contacted support via email and immediately received a response. The good thing is they did give me a credit but I had already bought food from a 2nd location thinking I’d get my money back. At that point I preferred my money back instead of a credit.

My order purchased was $31, so I felt at best I would be getting fresh food. Except the food I received was HORRIBLE AND YOU COULD TELL OLD! I customized requests for absolutely no condiments on my burgers it looked like the opened old food and scraped off the Mayo and added the requested extras, the poppers and cheese sticks were dried and hard in the inside. Same with onion rings and fries. The only thing that was fresh was the 8 piece nuggets I ordered for my dog’s.

Now I say it’s a money grab, because the only way you seem to be able to enter the contest/promo is by placing an order through the app.  The app only takes credit or debit cards.  And if you see how many people have issues getting refunds for app purchases, it shows they just care about taking your money.  The app doesn’t take gift card (money already spent) so they just want to push the promo as app based, even though they say you can enter your receipt info (which is broken), so they can get money now that it’s hard to get refunded.

33,5,My own little slice of Burger King Heaven,"For years I would have to drive all around town to secretly quench my overwhelming Burger King thirst, but NO MORE.

 I used to visit my local BK so frequently the staff would start to make fun of me. This happened for months and got to the point they would do it openly and sometimes even with other customers. 

I remember once when an employee told the family behind me they could cut in front of the “little fatty chicken fry boy” because I had “no where to be for no one who loves me”. It was at that moment I realized I would have to start visiting all my local BKs  evenly and at different points in the day. Making sure to mixup in person visits with drive through trips. I started charting my visits and that worked for many years. 

However, recently my yearning for BK has ran that well dry. I get mocked at every BK in the lobby and at the drive through. They all recognize my voice. That’s all changed though now with the BK app. I can order my food anonymously and have it delivered that way also! The only hiccup I ran into was noticing the same delivery man bringing me food, I cut that off at the bend though and now I make sure to 1 star every driver to ensure I don’t get the same driver!

34,1,Absolutely horrific on iPhone 7,"First and foremost, this app KILLS the battery. It needs to refresh each and every time you switch off the app. Searching and selecting a location takes at least a minute; 3/4ths of which is spent twiddling your thumbs waiting for the app to respond. Trying to pay at all is a nightmare. I got to the payment screen and my phone got hot enough to fry eggs. Not to mention the fact that the app would be unresponsive for LITERALLY minutes at a time. I had to stick my phone in the freezer to cool it down enough for the processor to work at normal speed. I have no idea how a BURGER APP of all things cripples a smart phone but I nevertheless am appalled. And God help you if you need to add a source of payment, because the app will make that take as long as possible. I spent 20 minutes trying to add a credit card to the app so it could add $10 to my crown card because it had insufficient funds, only for it to tell me it was invalid (why would you not have the option to pay at the store??).

People that use the McDonald’s app and the Burger King app on a regular basis well quickly realize that Burger King’s food is much better, fresher, and just overall a higher quality of food.

This review should serve as a warning, please don’t download this app. I placed and order through the app and my card was automatically drafted for the order total. When I went to the store to collect my food, I was informed by the extremely rude employee “We out of meat”. I asked if I could substitute something because I was hungry and had already paid and was told “No, you need to call the app if you want a refund”. After calling the 800 number given on the app I was informed I would be getting a phone call to refund my money, it has been a week and that call has never came. I will never use this app or eat at a BK again. Will be filing a complaint through the App Store, my bank and the BBB if I don’t receive my refund this week.

Update: After around a month of calls not being returned, getting the run around from “support staff” and hour long wait times I’ve come to the conclusion that BK will not refund.

I’m amazed at the majority of the complaints and bad reviews about it, until I realize most people are giving the app a bad rating because of how individual restaurants are operating or employee conduct. That’s completely separate. Complain about the restaurants and staff elsewhere, people!  

If I were to have anything negative to say at all, it would be that the app requires updates too often for my liking, or that BK should advertise this differently. Using the app does not allow a customer to “skip the line” as even using it, we still have to get in line inside or on the drive thru to announce we’re there to pick up our orders. The app only speeds up the process by the time it takes to place the actual order and pay.

Also when you get to the drive through you just tell them that you have a mobile order and they ask for your name and then bam, you pull through and they hand you your order and it’s so easy. 

Only complaint is that there isn’t currently a way to request condiments via the app and I like my fries the European way (with mayo), so I have to either remember to ask when I’m at the window or I guess it’s just wasted potato.",2021-11-12 08:13:07,False,Ndhrufif,,Burger King

So we wanted Burger King for dinner and I decided to try using their mobile app.  I download the App and got the order in and headed over to pick things up at the BK in Walmart accross the street.  I go into the store and expect to be handed my order and away I go.  Well I get in and am informed that they ran out of Whoppers (Seriously they are out of Burgers?  It’s  in their name!).  I decided to cancel the order and go someplace else.  Well... since I ordered through the app the store can’t refund me and it can’t be canceled in the app.  I ended up subsituting  random food off the menu and when they brought things to the counter I reminded them I needed the Twix pies.  I had to show them my order because it did not come through to their system. They then told me were out of the pies as well.  Long story long they have issues to work out with their mobile app (and apparently inventory forecasting.)

Please try another payment method.”  I’ve worked with their IT support for 2 months now.  Clear the cache, uninstall the app and reinstall, they reset the app on their end, etc.  It worked one time and then right back to the same problem.  One IT guy said the app is trying to prevent fraud.  What fraud?  I have used different credit cards, Apple Pay too, none work with the app.  I can pay INSIDE with Apple Pay or my credit cards just fine but not through the app.  The app is clearly unnecessarily blocking payments.

Why doesn’t it let me select “curbside pickup” instead forcing me to select drive through so I have to look up the number of the restaurant and call them because my vehicle can’t fit through the drive through?

So I attempted using Apple Pay, which is linked to my bank account. Same error. Tried a third form of payment with the same effing error! Finally got so frustrated, I drove off.

To add to this, there is NO ONE to contact when there is a mistake to be corrected. They deliver through Doordash on their app. I contacted Doordash, but they just told me to contact BK since the order was placed through them directly. So disappointed :(

Edit: BK seems to have read my review. The email included a link to contact them. When I clicked on it, it said “This page does not exist.” Kind of impressed they read the review, but too bad there is still no resolution.

I stopped by the McDonald’s up the street on Thursday night only because I had a free sandwich coupon Free or not free it was terrible. While I was in there an employee walked around the counter took an ink pen and yelled to the others and I quote “I’m going down to Burger King does anyone want anything”  3 employees stepped out and gave her money and she wrote their orders down and one even gave her a coupon. I thought to myself if I was fortunate enough to own a restaurant and my employees were ordering like this especially in front of a customer I believe I’d have to ask them to find a new job.

Once you’re finally able to order your meal (after your youngest child goes off to college) the payment hardly ever works. Whether you’re using Apple Pay or your own card payment the app will often crash or just not process the payment which leaves you in this scary, quadruple payment limbo until everything could/couldn’t, should/shouldn’t, does/doesn’t clear from your bank account. Not to mention when you finally break through to the fast food gods and get to the restaurant, they act like they’ve never heard of an online order before.

I’ve asked the servers at the pickup window, “How do I skip the line?” None of them have an answer - just a blank stare. Another downside. If I order ahead and still have to suffer thru waiting in line, that just makes my food colder, and the drinks more watered down. C’mon corporate weenies.

73,1,"Yep, still a useless app","Figured I’d check in again after a few months.... still as useless. Maybe even more so. I’ve tried over a dozen times since then, at 4 different BKs without a single successful order via the app or their website. Plenty of double charges, nonexistent customer support, and many frustrated store employees (who have always be champs trying to troubleshoot my issues and tell me this is a constant issue they have to deal with).

Old review: Even since they updated the app to be a poor re-skin of a mobile website it’s never worked correctly. Email sign-in never works the first time (and often second or third), offers appear and disappear, orders rarely go through, and when they do the stores often don’t get them so I have to re-give the entire order plus have to argue when I’m invariably double charged via the app. Don’t even bother trying to contact support, you’ll get 4-6 nonsensical excuses or promises of some kind of compensation that never happen.",2020-11-16 00:01:38,True,Whatjanesays,"{'id': 17517454, 'body': 'We’re bummed to hear that you didn’t have the most ideal experience.

I called again and was told they don’t refund orders submitted to the wrong restaurant and was told that you just had to drive to that restaurant to get your order.

So we had to restart the app to re-unlock the discount and try a different BK (it wouldn’t let us without restarting the app). We ended up placing our orders at a location farther away and drove there. When we get there the restaurant was closed without any notice from the app. It was only 9 PM, not a holiday or anything. The store must be shutting down, but it would have been nice to know that. The whole ordeal took 40 minutes for nothing. I’m just glad we didn’t get charged.

Also, please consider accepting Apple Pay as a payment option, both in the stores and especially in the app. Having to manually type and save a credit card number into an iPhone app is so 2015!

Last night I ordered at 10:58pm because it said the store was open until 1am, but when I got there the store was closed. It already charged me and there was no way to cancel or get a refund. I waited until the morning and called their horrible customer service department, which doesn’t even handle refunds. They just put in a request for a refund. The customer service agent was the smartest and was super dry with me on the phone. She didn’t sound empathetic, didn’t provide with a time frame of when I would get a refund, and said a supervisor wasn’t available. You could tell she hated her job.

84,1,Delivery service may run away with your food,"App in of itself is serviceable. Unfortunately due to the TOTAL disconnect between doordash ( which they use for delivery ) and them, if your driver runs off with your food you are screwed. Happened to me - driver supposedly picked up the order, ran away with the food and then apparently canceled the pick-up. Another driver was assigned to pick up, and was told it had already been picked up. 2nd driver asked if he could “cancel” the pickup, I said that was OK and he proceeded to mark it as “delivered”. Basically, on the wrong day, the entire process is a mess.

BK provide zero guarantees for a pickup service that THEY chose to use ( they have not even responded to a refund request ). The store will claim they have no power to issue refunds, and the app has no live support.

Doordash is a joke as well. Their system should mandate that both the business and the driver have the capability to mark something as picked up. The moment those two do not match should be when their customer service ( if they have any) take action. If that was the case, it would have been flagged immediately the driver attempted to cancel because the restaurant would have already marked it as picked up. If they have this feature already, then it is clearly broken.

I don’t particularly care about the money.

Also I’ve noticed that on any of the other stuff if you want something extra or whatever, they don’t list all the options. Burger King’s old motto used to be, “Have  it your way.” — Well, you can’t have it your way with the mobile order unless you tell them after you get there. — And that’s fine for most people, but the thing that I love about any mobile order is that it is more Deaf Friendly for those with hearing or speech problems compared to ordering in person. But when it’s not set up like the registers are and you really can’t do it exactly how you could in person, it’s not at all Deaf Friendly. — It’s more discriminatory.

Well, to my surprise, when I arrived at the BK it turned out that both orders were processed (the “failed”one included) and I got double charged! Obviously I didn’t need the 2nd order but the BK rep at the location directed all concerns to the app and any refund would have to go through the app. The app does not have a phone # to call, it only has a very generic feedback form to fill out where you can’t even properly explain yourself due to number of characters limits. I have nothing against BK as a restaurant but the app is not good. It has no support if you have an issue.

Sometimes I got a message that the offer wasn’t valid “until 10:30” even though it was well after 1:00 in the afternoon when I tried to order.

But if you then just hit the drive-thru, they won’t honor the offer since it’s only available if you order online!?!  

If this was only an isolated problem, I could understand.  But to have exactly the same problem . . . and the same response . . . from multiple locations, suggests that this is . . . at best . . . a systemic problem.

The BK iOS app programmers have mostly fixed the payment backend, it can now even deal with adding in temporary credit or debit card to finish a transaction outside of using Apple Pay.

The newest BK app update opens relatively quick. Once you start looking around at items to order, it doesn’t slow down anymore, a nice step forward. It is no longer slow once you have added a “deal” to the cart and go back to add the required dollar amount of product to finish the order. I only needed to wait a few seconds, not minutes like before, for additional app button presses to respond.

There were no crashes observed with my latest order. It also no longer asks to update the app after I tap the order button.

It did not ask my location to order from, it remembered from last time. Overall, the huge memory issues with the app are gone. Ordering through this app is nearly a fast experience.

100,4,Good app but needs minor improvement,Overall the ordering procedure is fast and efficient unfortunatelyWhen it comes to the à la cart menu is where the app fails. there needs to be a separate menu for the à la carte menu items which would make it easier instead of having to go through each individual meal just to pick the entrée and delete the other items also there needs to be an option for main entrée meals to remove the drink maybe I don’t want to Coca-Cola baby I want a milkshake instead or maybe I don’t want to drink at all these options do not exist. On a final noteWhen it comes to ordering chickenNuggets there needs to be a way to add more than one sauce if I want 10 sauces and a $.30 apiece then I’ll pay form but there is currently no option.,2020-07-10 22:13:19,False,Roadjockey,,Burger King

Then one day the lobby was closed for cleaning or something. Now I’m pretty upset that the chick was really rude about it, I mean I wasn’t asking for a manager or anything and I understood that it was out of her hands, but the bigger problem is that they had no way of telling the app the lobby was closed so of course no problem showed up on the app and I had every reasonable expectation of being able to go pick up my food.  If I’d seen it was closed it’d have been no big deal at all but to make matters worse, I STILL HAD TO PAY FOR THE FOOD I DIDN’T GET.  So not only is a customer jilted but the online till (is there such a thing?) comes out over - significantly over, if I’m not the only one who got punked.

128,1,Great when it works,I use this app quite a bit thanks to the deals you can get and my favorite feature: customizing your order.  I’m a picky eater.  So getting food how I like it from restaurants is sometimes a pain.  This feature takes the pain out of it when it works.  Problem is it doesn’t always work.  I just went through the drive thru a couple blocks from my house and did the mobile order like I usually do.  Except instead of getting the toppings I asked for I got everything I didn’t ask for.  I came back and they fixed it right but they said the order came in with everything instead of what I asked for.  This isn’t their fault they followed what was according to the order.  This is an issue on the app and it needs to be fixed.  This isn’t the first time it happened and it probably won’t be the last.,2020-06-14 16:57:52,False,Kscomptech,,Burger King

When placing orders the tracking stops halfway so knowing when the driver is close is not possible. Calling the delivery person doesn’t work either. When calling it comes up with a “this number doesn’t exist anymore”. When you’re refunded an order and given a $5 off coupon you cannot use any of the offers and when you use the $5 off coupon and the order gets canceled you lose the $5. Somehow for whatever reason the app is just broken for deliveries. To be honest if you have a Wendy’s nearby to get delivery just do that instead because I still have yet to experience a broken bug and issues from Wendy’s since they care about their own app and customers.,2021-11-24 23:13:12,False,Nyvek94,"{'id': 26485404, 'body': 'We’re bummed to hear that you didn’t have the most ideal experience.

My biggest complaint by far — the app does not appear to work on the weekends.  Three times now, on weekend days in the past 2 months, the app sends a message that it’s “...not able to connect to [Burger King’s] servers”.  It’s very frustrating, because you won’t know it until you’re ready to check out.  This cost them a star.  

BTW, they will not charge your card or begin to make your food until you click the “I’m Here” button.  Of course you can click that button any time.  

A note about a quirk:  After clicking the app’s “I’m here” button, I expected to go in, sit down, and they would call my (mobile) ordering number as they do when you order at the counter (you can indicate that you want to DINE IN on the app).   Ah, no.  As I was somewhat brusquely told on my first online order, you must go through the line and tell them —IN PERSON— that you are “here” and that you placed a mobile order.  Hmmmm.  Ok.

The “no lettuce“ was no problem, as there was an option to leave items off of a sandwich. I could not, however, add extra mayonnaise or extra pickles, as there was no way to do that, so it had to be done manually after I got to the window, adding unnecessary time to my order.

Unacceptable for an app that is not calculating astrophysics.

Next thing is that it’ll jump from pickup to delivery option while you’re going through the options of what you want to order. It’s a bit mysterious why that happens but it never fails to annoy me.

So several months ago Burgerking updated there app and when they did it logged me out of the app, No big deal ill just log back in right?... wrong.  I go to sign in, the app says wait 3 minuets for an email if nothing comes hit resend. I do this. Nothing happens I hit resend still nothing.  I figure its a glitch so i uninstalled and reinstalled same issues.  I try emailing a specialist, no response.  I try once more still nothing...

239,1,App Showed Wrong Hours of Operation,"Caveat emptor; not only did this app fail to deliver to expectations but Burger King Customer Support failed to deliver on their end.  The app showed the wrong hours of operation and an order was placed on the app in good faith the store would be open.  

When I pulled into the parking lot to collect the food I paid for, the parking lot was empty and the stores lights were turned off.  

The app’s solution to cancelling an order was to redirect to the Burger King website where I located a phone number to call Customer Support.  I called the next day to see if I could receive a credit.  After talking to a human male who had a difficult time understanding my American dialect, I was told another team would be contacting me (who never did).

Further checking the app for other food information, it showed the message ”There was a problem downloading the update.“  The  app shows it’s up to date in the app store and no updates are pending.

- Doesn’t save the delivery address so you have to enter it every time even after you’ve signed up

Pros:
- Super easy to navigate
- App is kept up to date with the current menu

I’ve tried both the delivery and drive thru pickup methods and didn’t have any issues with my orders.  Only issue I continue to run into is you can’t request  condiments in the app and the stores don’t automatically give you ketchup or sauces. At least my area doesn’t.

327,1,"Very time consuming, poor app design","I tried to use your redesign app , found it shocking bad 
Issues
1) enter email, no password manager or quick fill 
2) received email - after fishing it out of spam - you have 3 minutes- but I driving , want to drive though.
3) the app will not allow more then 1 offer , even common ones like mix/match 2 for $6 - so you have to order in 2 different ways to complete order 
4) now at payment screen sitting in drive through line - you want life history- name, address , card number, security codes, dates , etc etc - no quick fill options , no Mobile payment support, no credit card scan, you made this as difficult as possible. The person taking my order was able to duplicate the offers , saved me from going to McDonald’s.

I prefer Burger King but will either use paper coupons, manually order drive through- or go else where.  You had a good app before. Now you need to order the day before at home, to meet the requirements of your app.  Why do you need my home address anyhow? no Apple pay ?",2020-01-31 15:39:49,False,Doug77777,,Burger King

Also, I don’t understand why sometimes management in Payson deems it okay to substitute items then on other occasions vehemently refuses to substitute items.

1) I can use Apple Pay with the same two cards with every other app that supports Apple Pay and it works fine

2) My wife has one of the same credit cards set up in her Apple Pay and that works fine in the BK app or any other app with Apple Pay

3) I can manually enter the same card details into the BK app and it will work (just as long as I don’t use Apple Pay), but the whole point is that I don’t want to enter my credit card details all over the place.

The interface is also very clunky, no section for combos, it just lumps them with everything else. It can be pretty difficult at times to find what you’re looking for on the app. Also there’s plenty of glitches, one of the most common glitches I encountered was if I got nuggets it wouldn’t let me pick a sauce, the only option was none.

So then I opted to get a similar deal with 2 bacon cheeseburgers instead. “Not available at his location” it said... okay? Then why display it? Why not adjust the deals to the location? What year are we in? Why is this app increasingly inconvenient and causing more work just to order burgers and fries? 

Welp... Regardless of what you select, now the app for some reason says it can’t get the item pricing and you’re just sitting at the checkout waiting, unable to make your purchase... wow. Lol. Great work guys.

My wife likes her whopper without the meat. Not an option on the app. I applaud BK by making vegetarian options (that taste like meat), but she doesn’t like the taste of meat or the fake meat. 

Half the time when ordering at the store they ring up her no meat whopper correctly and we only get charged a fraction of the cost (it’s a bun with veggies and condiments it should cost $5).

852,1,Poor Payment Processing,This app is actually getting worse not better. Lately is has trouble processing payment either from Apple Pay or a stored credit card.

853,1,App not user friendly.,"I thought the app would make it easier to order and pay ahead with card to avoid handling cash. Nope! You have to ‘sign up’ each time you open the app, then wait for email, open email, click the link (within 3 minutes) to open and then sign in to the app again. 

By the time I get through this process, I’m frustrated and don’t feel like BK. There’s 5 other fast food places (3 which can be seen from BK parking lot) and 2 others just down the road. 

Please make the app user friendly... I know I would be more likely to use it!

One should be able to tap the app and place an order quickly. 

If anyone from BK corporate reads this, please change this app.

**Original Review**
Not sure how this app has a 4.7 rating. Click Sides -> click any item -> click back. Instead of going back to the previous screen (Sides) it dumps you onto the main menu.

Deductions: 1 star for mediocre UX, 1 star for some painfully obvious bugs, and 1 star because those bugs have not been fixed for months.

In these situations, you’re on your own. You can’t get a refund through the app. You’re told to have the restaurant correct the problem or dispute it with your bank. The restaurant can’t fix it if they aren’t open, and if they refuse to admit the mistake wasn’t your, do you really think they’re going to give you a refund?

Now no payments are working (was using ApplePay which has now been broken for weeks). Even tried adding a card (horrible keyboard interaction on iPhone X) and that failed. Pretty amazing that an app designed to take payments accepts no payments.

Fix your bugs and stop making us login.  Or how about a Touch ID verification? Anything would be better than this life sucking, never changing, wincing app you are trying to pass off as technology.
